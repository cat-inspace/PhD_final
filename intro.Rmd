\section{General Introduction}

In many complex, highly concentrated food systems, characteristic structure-forming processes take place that have so far only been described in phenomenological terms. The structure of food products is created during the process of transforming the raw materials into the final product. Overall, it shapes the mouthfeel, which is expressed via sensory attributes such as creaminess, etc., but also plays a role in determining the intensity of the taste and aroma sensation. The dominant structure-forming components are mostly proteins that are ready to aggregate. Protein-rich product systems play an increasingly important role in human nutrition, but also in pharmaceutical biotechnology. Examples are clinical and geriatric nutrition, where swallowing problems require a specific structure or viscosity controllable by protein aggregates, e.g. to circumvent the problem of "dysphagia". On the other hand, in certain neurodegenerative phenomena, the occurrence of chronic diseases is often associated with the phenomenon of aggregation, albeit under very different milieu conditions than in food [@Mezzenga2013]. Elderly people and athletes require protein-rich foods to counteract progressive muscle loss and to support muscle building, respectively. Ignorant of the fundamental interrelationships of the structure-forming potential of proteins in highly concentrated systems, especially in complex multi-phased systems, one is currently not yet sufficiently able to make targeted use of protein-based structure formation in the sense of efficient, quality- and productivity-guided process control. Further, many modern pharmaceuticals today are proteins whose aggregation behavior determines their efficacy as therapeutic agents.
An emerging trend is the need for structure formation by rapid aggregation, generally for intensification of processes or, for example, in the design of food products in 3D printing processes. Here, novel structure formation processes are a prerequisite to achieve spontaneous solidification of the structure built from liquid or pasty base materials. 
In order to target such specific structure formation processes, it is necessary to understand protein aggregation and especially the interaction with dispersed phases on a molecular level [@Hubbard2003a]. Many studies have been performed on a microscopic scale on the aggregation phenomena in colloidal, or rather liquid systems such as emulsions. *Cite Review Papers* *Cite and explain relevant studies* On the other side of the spectrum, many studies have been performed on the physical properties of gelled or solidified systems. *Cite Review Papers* *Cite and explain relevant studies*. 
A specific food system, which can be generalized in away that it is generic towards many food systems, is processed or cream cheese. On the one hand, it is a heat-set gel, where aggregation processes occur during the heating phase, that lead to a gelled structure in cold state. On the other hand, it has a dispersed phase embedded in the gel structure, wherein the emulsification of the dispersed phase also occurs during the heating phase. The heating phase is referred to as processing, however the term processed cheese shouldn't lead to the assumption that store-type cream cheese isn't processed using heat. An intensive study on the structural behaviour of commercial cream-cheese products has been performed by @Dang2019. Structure formation processes in processed, or sometimes also referred to as analogue cheese samples was performed *inter alia* by @process_cheese. @Lamichhane2018 gives an overview for the scale levels in cheese and their functional domains. Since processed cheese is either a reformed or newly formed structure, the the microscale might be represented differently.

knitr::include_graphics("images/scales_cheese_Lamichhane2018.jpg")
```
On further consideration, such systems can be considered as "soft solids" as in @Dickinson2012. Such structures can be either described as emulsion filled or particulate gels. Hence the main difference lies in the embedding of the dispersed phase into the structured continous phase. The structured continous phase in processed or cream cheese is built by caseins. As amphoteric proteins, caseins also emulsify the fat or fatty phase. Hence, investigating processed or cream cheese as a representative for a soft, solidified or gelled dispersed food system can provide insight into the structuring mechanisms of such structures. It might also give hints towards the occurence of aggregation phenomena, or investigations of such, in biogenic systems in general.

\subsection{Casein: structure and functionality}

Milk contains two main classes of proteins, the mostly globular and heat sensitive whey proteins and the major milk proteins: Caseins. Caseins can be isolated from milk, using acid treatment at pH 4.6 and 20°C. Under these circumstances, the Caseins will percipitate due to the screening of electrostatic repulsion. This happens as an effect of being close to the IEP, whereas whey (and other) proteins will stay in solution. Since milk proteins are thus seperated relatively easy, first research on Caseins was performed as early as the beginning of the 19th century [@Huppertz2018a].

\subsubsection{The Casein Micelle}

The Casein Micelle is a highly aggregated particle, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions internally. Externally, it is stabilized by steric repulsion through the outer "hairy-layer", mainly consisting of $\kappa$-Casein. With a surface area of about 4000 m2/l at a specific mass of 1.11 g/ml (20°C) and a number of 1014-1016 micelles/ml of raw milk, caseins are the main component of milk proteins. **Quelle** The average molecular weight of a micelle (dehydrated) is about 108 daltons. The micelle itself is composed of four different casein fractions, of which different genetic variants exist: $\alpha$s1-, $\alpha$s2-, $\beta$- and $\kappa$-casein. The percentage ratio of the total protein is 30:8:30:10. The dry matter of a micelle comprises 94% protein and 6% colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP). **Quelle**
CCP further comprises magnesium, calcium, phosphate, citrate, sodium and potassium ions. The exact structure of the casein micelle is not yet fully known and many models have been proposed. **Quellen** 
The effect of high pressure (150-300MPa) on the casein micelle structure in milk showed the occurence of small micelles next to large micelles under the use of cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Higher pressurization rates of 400 MPa resulted in the formation of smaller casein assemblies of 30-100 nm in size. It was also found, that free Calcium was taken in by the casein structures and that the substructures induced by high pressure treatment can be also found in untreated milk (@Knudsen2010). This shows, that the caseins are highly prone to self-assembly and aggregation, especially under the presence of calcium ions.


**Structure of the casein micelle - Dual Binding Model**

According to investigations of @Huppertz2017, the stabilisation of the micelle in the interior takes place via the CCP nano-clusters. This was found by investigating differently bound water in the casein micelle. It was possible to identify non-sperical particles, which were referred to as primary casein particles (PCP), which form a porous micelle structure through linkages via calcium phosphate nanoclusters. What's interesting here is that seemingly rebuilt casein micelles from sodium caseinate displayed similar properties as native and dried casein micelles in terms of radius of gyration, or particle size.

knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/PhD/data/Rstudio/Rdata_diss/thesis/images/micelle_Dalgleish.jpg")
```
In the model of the casein micelle from @Dalgleish2012a, CCPs are connected to the phosphorylated serine side chains of the caseins via a calcium phosphate bridge, as indicated by the grey spheres. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces contribute to the stabilisation. Among the casein fractions homogeneously distributed inside, the $\kappa$-casein sits at the surface of the micelle and stabilises the micelle through its outwardly directed, strongly hydrophilic and negatively charged part, the casein macropeptide (CMP). The negative charge causes steric repulsion of the micelles from each other, which leads to colloidal stability of the micelle. The hydrate shell additionally stabilises the micelle.
The hydrophilic parts on the surface of the micelle, which protrude into the serum phase, are often also referred to as the "hairy layer". Also of importance is the fact that a casein micelle is not a static system, but is in a dynamic equilibrium with the milk serum. This equilibrium can be disturbed mainly due to the calcium sensitivity of the individual casein fractions. While $\kappa$-casein reacts quite insensitively to calcium ions, the two $\alpha$s-fractions are strongly calcium-sensitive. By binding calcium ions on the surface, the outer $\kappa$-casein protects the calcium-sensitive casein fractions inside the micelle and thus prevents a calcium-induced structural change @Huppertz2018a.


**Structure of the casein micelle - Submicellar Model**

Another model for the structure of the casein micelle was presented previously by @WALSTRA1999189. This model describes sub-micelles with CCP incorporated into the sub-micelles. Analogue to the Dual-binding-model, the micelle is stabilized towards the serum phase through a "hairy-layer" of $\kappa$ casein pertruding into the serum phase. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Sub-micelle binding model as presented by @WALSTRA1999189: caseins are arranged in spherical sub-micelles, in which CCPs are incorporated"}

```

\subsubsection{The Caseins and their interaction}

Caseins can be described as amphoteric Phosphoproteins with different hydrophobicities [@Horne2017]. Their amino acid composition is not unlike those of globular proteins, however, the high level of proline hinders caseins to form globular structures. Four different gene products of caseins can be found not only in bovine milk, the $\alpha$s1-, $\alpha$s2-, $\beta$-, and $\kappa$-casein [@Huppertz2018a]. The interactions of caseins that lead to the initial formation of micelles, as well as their interaction properties in general, are still being debated [@Horne2017, @Horne2017b, @Holt2013, @Thorn2015]. However there seems to be a common understanding on two major types of casein interactions that lead to micelle formation, hydrophobic interactions and the formation of calcium phosphate nanoclusters [@Lucey2018]. 

The models presented earlier in this section are both based on the long established theory that hydrophobic interactions are a driving force for micelle assembly as well as casein aggregation [@Horne2017b]. Hydrophobic interactions occour under the exclusion of water. When two opposing surfaces get close, an energy benefit arises from the new conformation of the water molecules that were disrupted by the interacting surfaces or structures. 

\subsection{A complex food system: processed cheese}

In a highly concentrated protein systems, such as processed or cream cheese, wherein large protein aggregates are present, the inner structure is usually very complex and influenced by numerous factors. Furthermore, proteins in biogenic systems generally occur in different molecular structures as well as molecular scales. Such food systems often are multi-phased systems. Thus, proteins arise in combination with other substances, such as fat or carbohydrates.

Processed cheese serves as an example of a complex, highly-concentrated, and multi-phased protein system. Milk proteins (caseins), fat, and water form a dense network, triggered by the reaction of caseins with melting salts. The structure-forming reaction takes place in several stages and only under certain process conditions. Although the technology of melting cheese production is rather old, this protein-based structure formation cannot yet be adequately explained. The process control can thus not be used in an optimal and targeted manner.
This structure elucidation aims to analyse and better understand the reaction processes in processed cheese production. First, this will make it possible to intervene in the production process to optimise the efficiency and quality of the process and the product. In addition, the knowledge gain can also be transferred to other areas, whereby protein reactions can be triggered in a more targeted and faster manner. This could, for example, accelerate the formation of structures through protein aggregation and thus lead to intensification and increase in the efficiency of processes. A possible and promising field of application for this reaction is, for example, the 3D printing of food, in which a structure can be built up specifically from a liquid base material through rapid solidification or aggregation of the proteins.

\subsubsection{The Creaming Reaction}

The development of processed cheese took place around the beginning of the 20th century. The aim at that time was to develop a method to extend the shelf life of cheese and thus to store it longer and also to be able to export it. In 1911, the Swiss inventors W. Gerber and F. Stettler succeeded in transforming raw cheese into a homogeneous, flowable state through the application of sodium citrate as a melting salt. From this "sol" state, a solid, homogeneous "gel" formed again after cooling. At the same time, a processed cheese based on cheddar cheese was also developed in the USA. Here, citrates and orthophosphates were already used as melting salts. In 1917, the KRAFT company launched the first processed cheddar cheese on the market, which was initially intended for army rations. The company Gebrüder Wiedemann from Wangen in Allgäu did not conquer the European market until 1921.

Initially, the grinded cheese, cheese mass or protein-fat-mixture, is mixed with melting salts and then heated under constant shear. In this melting phase, the calcium is chelated by the melting salts and replaced by sodium. This results in a dispersion of the casein, which increasingly dissociates due to the lack of calcium phosphate bridges and binds the fat into the protein network. Emulsifying salts generally increase the stability of cheese emulsions under thermal treatment [@Hougaard2015]. During the production of processed cheese, first a gel-sol transition and then again a sol-gel transition take place. The transformation from insoluble gel to sol takes place through the application of heat and mechanical processing. This process works in processed cheese, in contrast to normal cheese, where only a phase separation would occur, through the addition of melting salts. The salts add effective charge carriers to the system, the calcium is removed from the casein by ion exchange, and the polypeptide chains bind water, resulting in swelling of the matrix. The subsequent sol-gel transition, in which the flowable mass becomes a solid cheese again, is achieved by subsequent cooling. Accordingly, the "creaming reaction" is an ion exchange reaction in which the gelatinous cheese structure is converted into an emulsion with a spreadable structure under the action of energy and melting salts. The subsequent structure build-up after melting, during which complex physicochemical reactions take place, is called post-creaming. If the structure loses its spreadability as a result of too long post-creaming, this is referred to as overcreaming of the processed cheese, which results not only in very solid gel formation but also in the escape of fat and water [@Lenze2019].

\subsubsection{Effect of processing conditions on the structure formation during creaming}

The final structure of the processed cheese depends on the starting material as well as the processing conditions. Various studies have been performed analyzing the effects of matrix composition and processing conditions on the final texture of the cheese matrix.
@Fu2018 investigated different emulsification conditions for their influence on the microstructure of a model cheese network. Stirring speeds of 400 rpm and 1500 rpm, and process times of 10 min and 30 min were varied. The microstructure of the resulting protein network was identified by SEM, and the distribution of the fat globules by CLSM. Regardless of the stirring speed, a so-called "fine-stranded-network", i.e. a network of protein (aggregates) arranged together like fibers, was shown here after 30 min. In addition, a start-up phase, as well as an exponential phase, was recognizable during the processing of the matrix of 30 min. However, longer processing times were not targeted here to identify the full course of protein aggregation. 
Another work by @Fu2018d dealt with the effect of rework, i.e. already pre-processed processed cheese mass added to the raw materials at the beginning of the reaction, and its effects on the structure formation. It was shown that only sufficiently processed mass can ensure acceleration of network formation. The effect of the rework is manifested by smaller fat globules and a finer, more ordered network in the final product. However, no mechanistic explanation of the processes is provided, but only the phenomenon or the effect of rework on the final product is described. @Cernikova2018a also studied the effect of rework at different concentrations (0 - 20% of dry matter). Again, smaller fat globules as well as a fine, fibrous network and increasing hardness of the final product were observed up to a rework concentration of 10%. When the rework concentration was increased further, no significant change in the final product was observed. Although this work provides a good overview of compositional and process-related effects of rework addition, it does not provide a mechanistic explanation. @Lenze2019 investigated a process cheese matrix and the effects of rework addition. Processing time was significantly reduced under rework addition. This effect was explained by an autocatlytic effect. Favourably aggregated proteins act, similar to a seeding effect in crystal systems, as a template which leads to structuring the other proteins in the system in the same way. From this, it could be concluded that proteins or proteinogenic systems structurally similar to caseins aggregate within a certain process environment to form hydrophobic clusters and then eventually to a large network stabilized via hydrophobic interactions.
@Guinee2004 also dealt with similar systems. Here, structure formation was interpreted as a consequence of hydration of proteins and as a consequence of increasing viscosity during cooling of the hot mass. To date, only a few studies have followed structure formation processes "online" during the manufacturing process (see for example @Lee2003a; @Fu2018; @Lenze2019), so little information is available on the progress of the reaction. A possible cause of the viscosity increase was described as exposure to the ionic environment with the effect of complexation of stabilizing calcium ions results in dissolution of the casein micelle, exposing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections of the individual caseins. Consequently, hydration of caseins occurred due to hydrophilic interactions with the aqueous phase and interactions of caseins with the fatty phase via hydrophobic interactions. These interactions also led to emulsification of the fatty phase. 
@Cunha2013 investigated the influence of different fats (soybean oil, partially hydrogenated soybean oil and milk fat) on the rheological, functional and sensory properties of spreadable processed cheese analogs. Smaller fat globules were observed in unhydrogenated fats, which was explained by the greater steric inhibition of unsaturated fatty acids and resulting, lower hydrophobic interactions among fat molecules. In addition, unhydrogenated, or unsaturated, fats have a lower viscosity, which makes the fat easier to break down during processing.

\subsection{Emulsion-filled-gels}

Process-cheese based casein gels can be viewed as emulsion-filled-gels (EFG). EFGs are soft solids with incorporated, emulsified fat droplets or fat particles [@Dickinson2012]. 
\subsubsection{Structure and stability of emulsion-filled-gels}

Emulsion-filled gels can be theoretically described as a rubbery material filled with solid particles, where Gm is shear modulus of the matrix and the exponential terms of the polynom is the Volume Fraction of the particles (i.e. fat globules).   
For a Volume Fraction of the coated droplets up to 35% (which is probably the case in my cheese model), the shear modulus of the composite Gel can be described after the Padé approximation. The deficiencies of the models lie in the negligence of the crowding effect of the filler particles (i.e. Flocculation of globules)  [@Dickinson2006].

\subsubsection{The role of fat in emulsion-filled-gels}

active and inactive filler particles
@Chojnicka2009 studied the lubrication properties and the friction of emulsion filled gels under the effect of various oil concentrations. Higher concentrations of oil in the gel led to an increase in viscosity for gels, where the oil droplets got bound into the matrix during shearing.
