abstract = {1 H-31 P Cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) measurements of 40-d-old Mozzarella cheese and 20 mM EDTA-treated casein micelles revealed that each sample had immobile phosphorus with the same spectral pattern, which did not match that of native casein micelles. To identify the immobile phosphorus bodies, 1 H-31 P CP-MAS spectra and cross-polarization kinetics measurements were undertaken on native casein micelles, EDTA-chelated casein micelles, and reference samples of $\beta$-casein and hydroxyapatite. The results showed that the immobile phosphorus bodies in the mature Mozzarella cheese had the following charac-teristics: they are immobile phosphoserine residues (not colloidal calcium phosphate); they are not the prod-uct of phosphoserine to colloidal calcium phosphate bridging; the phosphate is complexed to calcium; their rigidity is localized to a phosphorus site; their rigidity and bond coupling is unaffected by protein hydration; and the immobile bodies share a narrow range of bond orientations. Combining these observations, the best explanation of the immobile phosphorus bodies is that bonding structures of phosphorus-containing groups and calcium exist within the casein micelle that are not yet clearly classified in the literature. The best candidate is a calcium-bridged phosphoserine-to-phosphoserine linkage, either intra-or inter-protein.},

abstract = {The “creaming reaction,” a general thickening of the molten cheese mass during the manufacture of processed cheese, which is often seen to occur in a stepwise fashion, affects the viscosity and texture of the finished product. Thus, this phenomenon is of critical importance for the processed cheese industry, yet mechanisms underlying the structure formation in this surprisingly complex and dynamic food system are only poorly understood. Using a model system consisting of micellar casein concentrate, vegetable oil, water, and a mixture of melting salts, we followed the characteristic viscosity profile with its primary and secondary increase over time. A rheometer equipped with a custom-made cup geometry was used, which served as a mini-reaction vessel to simulate the conditions during the manufacture of processed cheese. The mixture was subjected to constant heat (90°C) and stirring (7.93 rpm), comparable to processed cheese cooking, for up to 410 min. At specific time points, samples were taken, and the micro- and ultrastructure was investigated with light and transmission electron microscopy. Results from our extensive study uncovered the following key steps: (1) a decrease in fat globule size with concomitant increase in the number of fat globules, which were also more evenly distributed; (2) a progressive separation of the casein matrix into fibrillogenic and nonfibrillogenic fractions; (3) formation of fibrils and their higher-order structuring followed by their partial degradation; and (4) increasing interactions of the fibrils with the fat globule surface leading to a higher degree of emulsification. Of these different observations, results indicate that after the caseins dissociated under the influence of the melting salts, protein–protein interactions were the primary driver of the structure formation and thus contributed to the initial viscosity increase. Fat globules were involved in the structure formation at later time points. Therefore, fat–protein interactions in addition to continued protein–protein interactions were assumed to contribute to the secondary viscosity increase. An updated processed cheese creaming model is presented. The use of the term “texturization” instead of “creaming” is proposed.},

abstract = {Several studies have highlighted the leading role of the sequence periodicity of polar and nonpolar amino acids (binary patterns) in the formation of regular secondary structures (RSS). However, these were based on the analysis of only a few simple cases, with no direct mean to correlate binary patterns with the limits of RSS. Here, HCA-derived hydrophobic clusters (HC) which are conditioned binary patterns whose positions fit well those of RSS, were considered. All the HC types, defined by unique binary patterns, which were commonly observed in three-dimensional (3D) structures of globular domains, were analyzed. The 180 HC types with preferences for either $\alpha$-helices or $\beta$-strands distinctly contain basic binary units typical of these RSS. Therefore a general trend supporting the "binary pattern preference" assumption was observed. HC for which observed RSS are in disagreement with their expected behavior (discordant HC) were also examined. They were separated in HC types with moderate preferences for RSS, having "weak" binary patterns and versatile RSS and HC types with high preferences for RSS, having "strong" binary patterns and then displaying nonpolar amino acids at the protein surface. It was shown that in both cases, discordant HC could be distinguished from concordant ones by well-differentiated amino acid compositions. The obtained results could, thus, help to complement the currently available methods for the accurate prediction of secondary structures in proteins from the only information of a single amino acid sequence. This can be especially useful for characterizing orphan sequences and for assisting protein engineering and design.},

Several workers have further assumed that the core of the micelle is built of sub-micelles, i.e., roughly spherical units of about 14 nm diameter, which are fairly tightly aggregated. It was originally assumed that the sub-micelles are held together in the micelle by bridges consisting of calcium phosphate. However, several studies, notably by Holt, have made this concept untenable. This also has made the existence of sub-micelles doubtful. Some years ago, however, van Dijk proposed that in the process of milk synthesis, casein molecules associate into small mixed clusters and that subsequently calcium phosphate is deposited into these particles, which would make them more dense (containing less solvent) and of a lower charge. Consequently, the particles would lose their colloidal stability and aggregate to form casein micelles. This concept agrees well with electron microscopic observations, notably by Buchheim, on milk formation in the lactating cell. It would also fit Brownian dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations of aggregation of small particles exhibiting weak colloidal attraction. Moreover, it readily fits several indications for a dynamic equilibrium between casein micelles and sub-micelles, for which examples of these will be given.}

The regularization algorithms employed by the Uniform-Penalty inversion (UPEN) and CONTIN computer programs have been compared using simulated transverse (T2) relaxation data derived from a typical bimodal distribution observed in cartilage tissue which contain a component shorter than t0, the time of the first decay sample. We examined the reliability of detecting sub-t0 relaxation components and the accuracy of statistical estimates of T2 distribution parameters. When the integrated area of the sub-t0 component relative to that of the total distribution was greater than 0.25, our results indicated a signal-to-noise threshold of about 300 for detecting the presence of the sub-t0 component with a probability of 0.9 or greater. This threshold was obtained using both the UPEN and CONTIN algorithms. In addition, when using the second-derivative-squared regularizer, UPEN solutions provided statistical estimates of T2 distribution parameters which were substantially free of the biasing effect of the regularizer observed in analagous CONTIN solutions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Many of these functionalities are determined by cheese structure, requiring an appropriate understanding of the relationships between structure and functionality to design bespoke functionalities.

abstract = {The calcium-dependent swelling process of casein microparticles (CMPs) prepared by depletion flocculation and film drying was investigated in microfluidic chambers designed for microscopic single particle analysis. Replacing the buffer with deionised water caused CMPs to swell and decompose rapidly at pH 11. The addition of 0.1 mM CaCl2 at pH 11 stopped degradation and slowed the two-phase linear growth of the particle cross section. A significant flattening of this linear growth in both phases occurred at 1 mM CaCl2, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 almost no swelling happened. At pH 8 the addition of 0.1 mM CaCl2 prevented the swelling process. A dynamic model described the two-phase swelling behaviour of CMPs under the influence of calcium in a simple way. Based on these simulations and findings from confocal fluorescence microscopy of the internal structure, we derived a general model describing the two-phase calcium-regulated swelling process of CMPs.},

Maybe this can be shown with the development of dry matter ofer concentration at the interface after resolubilization.},

The cookers were operated at auger speeds of 750, 1,125 or 1,500 (Stephan) or 100 or 200 rpm (Blentech). Increasing the blade speed of the Stephan increased (P {\textless} 0.001) the hardness and decreased the meltability of imitation cheese from 112 to 66 mm respectively. Hardness and meltability values of cheeses made in the Blentech cooker were only slightly affected by auger speed. The cheese made in the Stephan at 1,500 rpm had the highest G' and G'' values at 25 degrees C of all the cheeses.

abstract = {The conformation of deamidated gliadins and $\beta$-casein in solution and adsorbed at the interface of oil-in-water emulsions was studied using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and front-face-fluorescence spectroscopy. Deamidation led to partial unfolding of gliadins in solution. The $\alpha$-helix content of the protein decreased from 35{\%} (in the native form) to 16.3{\%} while the percentage of $\beta$-sheet and unordered structure increased upon deamidation. The secondary structure of deamidated gliadins was largely unchanged upon adsorption to both tricaprin/water and hexadecane/water interfaces. In contrast, $\beta$-casein adopted a more ordered structure upon adsorption to these two oil/water interfaces, the $\alpha$-helix content increased from 5.5{\%} (in solution) to 20{\%} and 22.5{\%} respectively after adsorption to tricaprin/water and hexadecane/water interfaces. Both deamidated gliadins and $\beta$-casein have distinctive N-terminal hydrophilic and C-terminal hydrophobic domains. Unlike $\beta$-casein which contains no cysteine residue, gliadins have a large number of intramolecular disulphide bonds located in the C-terminal hydrophobic domain which constrains the conformational freedom of this protein upon adsorption to oil/water interfaces. The hydrophobicity of the oil phase also has an impact on the conformation of each protein upon adsorption to the oil/water interfaces – systematic trends were observed between oil phase polarity from: i) tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima, and ii) the $\alpha$-helix content in the adsorbed state. Our results demonstrate that conformational re-arrangement of proteins upon adsorption to emulsion interfaces is dependent not only on the hydrophobicity of the oil phase, but more importantly on the conformational flexibility of the protein.},

We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form $\Sigma$ $\beta$jXj by a sum of smooth functions $\Sigma$ sj(Xj). The sj({\textperiodcentered})‘s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor $\eta$ = $\Sigma$ $\beta$jXj is replaced by the additive predictor $\Sigma$ sj(Xj); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model. {\textcopyright} 1986, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

The creaming kinetics, determined by multiple light scattering (Turbiscan), showed that the phase separation of Na-CN-stabilized emulsions was markedly dependent on the duration of the heat treatment. The differences between unheated and heated emulsions were attributed to heat-induced physicochemical changes in the aqueous Na-CN nanoparticles. The heat treatment caused protein degradation and changed the intact Na-CN concentration in the continuous phase. The emulsion structures, with varied extents of depletion flocculation, were well reflected by small and large deformation rheology. In the recombined Na-CN emulsions, the depletion attraction was weakened at low and moderate Na-CN concentrations (2{\%} and 4{\%} w/w) but was strengthened at high Na-CN concentration (6{\%} w/w). The former structural change was predominantly due to reduced depletion attraction, whereas reduced depletion attraction and decreased continuous phase viscosity influenced the latter structural change. The intact Na-CN concentration in the continuous phase is determined by the heat-induced physicochemical changes of Na-CN nanoparticles, which played a significant role in the physical stability of the emulsions. The insights from this study can be used to create novel droplet sizes and protein particle sizes to manipulate the droplet/protein size ratio, and therefore the extent of droplet−droplet interactions.},

Regardless of reasons for their uniqueness, outliers strongly affect data interpretation when any method with the least-squares cost function is used.

The addition of TS caused the casein network structure to become dispersed, leading to increased firmness, and the addition of PS caused the casein network structure to become fine-stranded and brought the most firmness. In the PC2 group, the casein network structure was a fine-strand type. Both TS and PS had no obvious impact on the casein network structure and the firmness. The results of this study will help us to understand the roles of different textural starches contributing to the viscosity and mechanical properties in processed cheese with different types of casein network structures.},

abstract = {In multivariate data analysis we observe not only a single variable or the relation between two variables but we consider several characteristics simultaneously. For a statistical analysis of chemical data (also called chemometrics) we have to take into account the special structure of this type of data. Classic model assumptions might not be fulfilled by chemical data, for instance there will be a large number of variables and only few observations, or correlations between the variables occur. To avoid problems arising from this fact, for chemometrics classical methods have to be adapted and new ones developed. The statistical environment R is a powerful tool for data analysis and graphical representation. It is an open source software with the possibility for many individuals to assist in improving the code and adding functions. One of those contributed function packages - chemometrics implemented by Kurt Varmuza and Peter Filzmoser - is designed especially for the multivariate analysis of chemical data and contains functions mostly for regression, classification and model evaluation. The work at hand is a vignette for this package and can be understood as a manual for its functionalities. The aim of this vignette is to explain the relevant methods and to demonstrate and compare them based on practical examples.},

abstract = {Water in dairy products is a nonnutrient component, which, however, is the principal responsible determinant of important physicochemical properties and stability of dairy foods. Water, for example, is the main solvent of water-soluble components, such as lactose, proteins, and minerals, as well as water-soluble vitamins. Moreover, water has a crucial role in defining the physicochemical properties of dairy products, including viscosity, emulsion structure, and thermal properties, and it contributes to most processing requirements in the manufacture of dairy products. In addition, water has a key role in controlling microbial growth, product shelf life, palatability, and overall quality. One important property of water is its equilibrium relative vapor pressure or water activity. Water activity is a useful measure of water availability for the growth of various microorganisms and physicochemical stability of low-moisture dairy products. Water is also a plasticizer and it may control changes in the physical state, molecular mobility, and shelf life of low-moisture and frozen dairy products.},

Aggregates of calcium αs1- and αs2-caseinates were both thoroughly solubilized by 4 M urea. Gel filtration of αs1-casein and of αs2-casein in 4 M urea showed the same elution pattern in the presence and absence of 10mM calcium chloride. Dephosphorylated αs2-casein was insoluble at neutral pH although dephosphorylated αs1-casein was soluble. Dephosphorylated αs2-casein was solubilized by 4 M urea and alkalization to pH 11. The net proton charge, calculated from the primary structure, of dephosphorylated αs2-casein was very low at pH 7.0, although dephosphorylated αs1-casein has a considerable number of negative net charges. The calculated isoionic point of dephosphorylated αs2-casein, which contains one phosphate group, was 6.98. Ester phosphate groups of αs2-casein play an important role in its solubilization at neutral pH and neutralization of ionized phosphate groups by calcium ion increases hydrophobic interaction, which leads to precipitation.}

abstract = {Selective precipitation is a common method for the isolation of $\beta$-casein, using the different calcium sensitivities of the individual caseins and the selective solubility of $\beta$-casein at a low temperature. In previous studies, it has been indicated that the $\beta$-casein yield depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the casein raw material used for fractionation. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the solubility of $\alpha$ S- and $\beta$-casein in solutions of micellar casein, sodium caseinate, and calcium caseinate as a function of pH and temperature. Additionally, the solubility of isolated $\alpha$ S- and $\beta$-casein fractions in demineralized water, ultrafiltration permeate, and a calcium-depleted milk salt solution was investigated depending on the pH and temperature. Furthermore, micellar casein, sodium caseinate, and calcium caseinate were subjected to a calcium chloride-precipitation process to determine the solubility of $\alpha$ S- and $\beta$-casein in calcium chloride precipitate, which is produced during selective precipitation, as a function of temperature and pH. Generally, the temperature had only a marginal influence on the $\alpha$ S-casein solubility compared with the $\beta$-casein solubility, whereas the solubility was shown to be strongly influenced by the pH. Our results suggest that the yield of $\beta$-casein obtained during isolation by means of selective precipitation may be a result of the solubility characteristics of $\alpha$ S- and $\beta$-casein in calcium chloride precipitate. Manufacturers may consider a simple solubility experiment before the $\beta$-casein isolation process by means of selective precipitation to predict $\beta$-casein yield. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of several types of emulsifying salts (ES) on the texture of nonfat process cheese (NFPC). Improperly produced nonfat cheese tends to exhibit several problems upon baking including stickiness, insufficient or excessive melt, pale color upon cooling, formation of a dry skin (skinning) often leading to dark blistering, and chewy texture. These attributes are due to the strength and number of interactions between and among casein molecules. We propose to disrupt these interactions by using suitable emulsifying salts (ES). These ES chelate Ca and disperse caseins. Stirred curd cheese bases were made from skim milk using direct acidification with lactic acid to pH values 5.0, 5.2, and 5.4, and ripened for 1 d. Various levels of trisodium citrate (TSC; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 5{\%}), disodium phosphate (DSP; 1, 2, 3, and 4{\%}), or trisodium phosphate (TSP; 1, 2, 3, and 4{\%}) were blended with the nonfat cheese base. Cheese, ES, and water were weighed into a steel container, which was placed in a waterbath at 98°C and then stirred using an overhead stirrer for 9 min. Molten cheese was poured into plastic containers, sealed, and stored at 4°C for 7 d before analysis. Texture and melting properties were determined using texture profile analysis and the UW-Melt-profiler. The pH 5.2 and 5.4 cheese bases were sticky during manufacture and had a pale straw-like color, whereas the pH 5.0 curd was white. Total calcium contents were approximately 400, 185, and 139 mg/100 g for pH 5.4, 5.2, and 5.0 cheeses, respectively. Addition of DSP resulted in NFPC with the lowest extent of flow, and crystal formation was apparent at DSP levels above 2{\%}. The NFPC manufactured from the pH 5.0 base and using TSP had reduced melt and increased stickiness, whereas melt was significantly increased and stickiness was reduced in NFPC made with pH 5.4 base and TSP. However, for NFPC made from the pH 5.4 cheese and with 1{\%} TSP, the pH value was {\textgreater}6.20 and crystals were observed within a few days. Use of TSC increased extent of flow up to a maximum with the addition of 2{\%} ES for all 3 types of cheese bases. Addition of high levels of TSC to the pH 5.2 and 5.4 cheese bases resulted in increased stickiness. Similar pH trends for attributes such as extent of flow, hardness, and adhesiveness were observed for both phosphate ES but no consistent pH trends were observed for the NFPC made with TSC. These initial trials suggest that the pH 5.0 cheese base was promising for further research and scale-up to pilot-scale process cheese making, because cheeses had a creamy color, reasonable melt, and did not have high adhesiveness when TSC was used as the ES. However, the acid whey produced from the pH 5.0 curd could be a concern. {\textcopyright} American Dairy Science Association, 2008.},

abstract = {We studied the effect of inhomogeneity in oil droplet distribution at different length scales on the mechanical and sensory properties of emulsion-filled food gels. Two approaches were followed to obtain an inhomogeneous distributions at different length scales: (1) clustering of o/w-emulsions by hetero-aggregation and subsequent gelation to obtain inhomogeneity at $\mu$m-scale, and (2) incorporating particles of emulsion-filled gels into emulsion-filled gel matrices with a different volume fraction of oil droplets to obtain gel-in-gels with inhomogeneity at mm-scale. Upon clustering of oil droplets at $\mu$m-scale, the Young's modulus of the gels increased by up to 60{\%}, whereas fracture stress and strain depended on emulsifier-matrix interactions. Clustering of oil droplets affected mainly the perception of texture-related sensory attributes, such as hardness, but did not significantly affect the perception of fat-related sensory attributes. Fat-related sensory attributes, such as creaminess and melting, were dominated by emulsifier matrix interactions. For gel-in-gels, the inhomogeneous distribution of oil droplets at mm-scale did not affect Young's modulus or fracture strain. The incorporation of particles decreased the fracture stress of the gels, independently of the droplet distribution. The perception of fat-related sensory attributes changed significantly. Oiliness was lower in samples with lower oil content in the outer phase of the gel than in the inner dispersed particles, whereas coating perception increased in samples in which the oil droplet distribution was inhomogeneous, independently on whether the outer phase or the inner gel particles contained a higher oil volume fraction. Creaminess was only slightly affected. We conclude that oil droplet clustering at $\mu$m-scale can be used to modify mechanical properties and texture-related perception of emulsion-filled gels, whereas inhomogeneity at mm-scale allows altering fat-related sensations. Sensory perception can be controlled by modifying the interactions between dispersed oil droplets and matrix using different emulsifiers and by incorporating inhomogeneity in the oil droplet distribution of emulsion-filled gels at different length scales.},
annote = {I see the same effect in my models, the over-creaming process is dependent on the homogenity of the samples. Higher shear leads to faster over creaming, i.e. the end of the process due to formation of a particulate, almost cristalline gel. We could monitor this effect also in terms of the pre-homogenization of the model samples. Homogenized samples showed a decrease in protein concentration after reaching maximum adsorption, suggesting that the clustered proteins at the interface tend to leave the interface even before it is noticeable visibly, i.e. before having the cristalline/particulate appearance (show images of samples over time). Also, the addition of rework (previous) works showed far higher creaming rates with higher rework concentration in the samples. This can be interpreted as the incorporation of a gel in gel structure, as presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Oleogels contain oil or a non-polar liquid which is gelled with an agent called an organogelator. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the addition of silicone oil (cyclopentasiloxane) to the gelation process and to the properties of sorbitan monostearate (SMS)–sesame oil oleogel and compared with that of SMS–sesame oil oleogel and SMS–cyclopentasiloxane oleogel. Three different oil phases; sesame oil phase, cyclopentasiloxane phase and a mixture of cyclopentasiloxane and sesame oil, were used to prepare oleogels with SMS gelator. The critical gelling concentrations (CGC) for oleogels were determined using different concentration of SMS in a range of 5{\%}–22{\%} (w/w). The characterization of the developed oleogels was done using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), polarized light microscope, rheometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The addition of cyclopentasiloxane reduced the CGC of SMS–sesame oil oleogel from 20{\%} to 10{\%} (w/w). In microscopic characterization, the oleogels with a mixture of oil phases showed the longer and thicker three-dimensional gel network than that of oleogels with sesame oil and cyclopentasiloxane. FTIR studies demonstrated that this network formation was mainly due to hydrogen bonding. Rheological measurements revealed that the combination of cyclopentasiloxane and sesame oil produced strong gel with higher complex modulus values and longer linear viscoelastic region than oleogels prepared with sesame oil and cyclopentasiloxane. In addition, oleogels with the combination of the two oils had higher enthalpy ($\Delta$Hm) and entropy ($\Delta$Sm) thus could increase thermodynamic stability of the oleogels. Therefore, the addition of cyclopentasiloxane can improve the physical, thermal properties and stability of SMS–sesame oil oleogel, provide greater sensory profile and better product aesthetics. The developed oleogel can be a novel carrier for topical drug delivery.},

abstract = {The water holding capacity of casein gels was investigated by measuring the swelling and de-swelling under a variety of conditions of temperature and salt concentration. Transglutaminase cross-linked sodium caseinate (15{\%} w/w) gels will swell in good solvents or shrink in poor solvents until an equilibrium casein volume fraction is reached, and this is determined by the cross-link density. The results are interpreted using extended Flory-Rehner theory for weak polyelectrolytes. NaCl and CaCl2 solutions tend to shrink the gels through the decreased Donnan pressure. In contrast, high volume fraction renneted casein (48{\%} w/w) gels tend to swell in NaCl and CaCl2. These results are consistent with theory since the equilibrium volume fractions appear to be at an intermediate value (estimated about 20{\%}). Experiments on casein micelles, which can be considered nano-gels, show the same behavior and trends. Physically cross-linked gels such as a highly concentrated renneted casein gel and casein micelles show the same (de-)swelling behavior. Cross-linked caseinate gels (15{\%} w/w) have a lesser tendency to swell due to the lower casein volume fraction. Physically cross-linked gels will eventually completely dissolve in a good solvent. The results presented give a clear picture of the parameters that determine the equilibrium water content of a food polymer gel.},

abstract = {Many physical phenomena are described by first-order differential equations whose solution is an exponential decay. Determining the time constants and amplitudes of exponential decays from the experimental data is a common task in semiconductor physics (deep level transient spectroscopy), biophysics (fluorescence decay analysis), nuclear physics and chemistry (radioactive decays, nuclear magnetic resonance), chemistry and electrochemistry (reaction kinetics) and medical imaging. This review article discusses the fundamental mathematical limitations of exponential analysis, outlines the critical aspects of acquisition of exponential transients for subsequent analysis, and gives a comprehensive overview of numerical algorithms used in exponential analysis. In the first part of the article the resolution of exponential analysis as a function of noise in input decays is discussed. It is shown that two exponential decays can be resolved in a transient only if the ratio of their time constants is greater than the resolution limit, which can be explicitly calculated from the signal-to-noise ratio in the transient. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is generally limited by the sensitivity of the equipment, it is shown that digitalization of the decays may be a major source of noise. The requirements for type of analog-to-digital converter, number of digitized data points and duration of digitized transients, which must be met to obtain the theoretical resolution limit and to improve stability of the exponential analysis, are formulated. The second part of the review article gives an overview and comparison of major numerical techniques of exponential analysis, such as the nonlinear least squares fit, the Prony method, the method of modulating functions, the method of moments, the Laplace-Pad{\'{e}} approximation, the Tikhonov regularization method, the Gardner transformation, the method of maximum entropy and others. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {To obtain a molecular basis for the similarities and dissimilarities in the functional, chemical, and biochemical properties between ??-casein and the other caseins, three-dimensional models have been presented. Secondary structural prediction algorithms and molecular modeling techniques were used to predict ??-casein structure. The secondary structure of bovine ??-casein was re-examined using Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies to test these predictions. Both methods predict a range of secondary structures for ??-casein (28-32{\%} turns, 32-34{\%} extended) at 25??C. These elements were highly stable from 5 to 70??C as viewed by circular dichroism. More flexible conformational elements, tentatively identified as loops, helix and short segments of polyproline II, were influenced by temperature, increasing with elevated temperatures. Another view is that as temperature decreases, these elements are lost (cold denaturation). Several distinct transitions were observed by circular dichroism at 10, 33 and 41??C and another transition, extrapolated to occur at 78??C. Calculations from analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that the 10, 33 and 41??C transitions occur primarily in the monomeric form of the protein. As ??-casein polymers are formed, and increase in size, the transitions at higher temperature may reflect changes in the more flexible conformational elements as they adjust to changes in surface charge during polymer formation. The transition at 10??C may represent an actual general conformational change or cold denaturation. Over the range of temperatures studied, the sheet and turn areas remain relatively constant, perhaps forming a supporting hydrophobic core for the monomers within the micelle-like polymer. This interpretation is in accord with the known properties of ??-casein, and those predicted from molecular modeling. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The adsorption data presented in the preceding paper (Part II of this series) have been used to deduce the molecular structures of $\beta$-casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lysozyme films at the air-water and oil-water interfaces. The hydrophobic, disordered $\beta$-casein molecules are more surface-active than the globular BSA and lysozyme molecules. $\beta$-Casein is in an all-train configuration at low surface pressures ($\pi$ {\textless} 8 mN m−1) at the air-water interface and can be described by Singer's equation of state for linear polymers. At higher $\pi$ values, loop formation ensues, and the loops increase in density at the expense of the trains until in the close-packed, condensed state the ratio of amino acid residues in loop and train configurations is about 2:1. This conformational change does not occur at the oil-water interface because loops already form at low $\pi$; enhanced loop formation in the nonaqueous phase is favored because oil molecules solvate the hydrophobic residues. Multilayer formation occurs at high substrate protein concentrations ({\textgreater} 10−2 wt{\%}) giving films thicker than 100 {\AA}. Although the primary layer is irreversibly adsorbed, molecules in subsequent layers are reversibly adsorbed. Lysozyme molecules are denatured at low $\pi$ values ($\pi$ {\textless} 8 mN m−1), and at higher values essentially native molecules (which are reversibly adsorbed) coexist in the surface film. Much residual native structure remains even in the denatured film because lysozyme is very resistant to denaturation. At the oil-water interface, the adsorbed lysozyme molecules are denatured to a greater extent than those at the air-water interface; native molecules are not stable at this interface. The adsorbed BSA molecules contain residual native structure, but there is no abrupt conformational change in the film at a particular packing density. The structure at the air-water interface is intermediate to those of lysozyme and $\beta$-casein. BSA has the same $\pi$-A curve as lysozyme at the oil-water interface.},

In this competitive scenario, dairy foods have been developed to provide functional components and/or meet specific dietary needs, such as those observed in the setting of obesity and hypertension. Processed cheese, which originally has high-sodium and fat contents in its formulation, may also undergo a reformulation. In addition, nowadays, the addition of prebiotic ingredients into dairy products is a common technological practice to not only enhance their beneficial health effects but also to improve the final texture, replace fat components, and increase the fiber content.

The protein matrix became more compact and the size of the fat globules decreased with the incorporation of small individual fat globules, aggregates and fat globules of irregular form into the matrix. The predominant bonds in the curd before the stretching stage were hydrophobic interactions, whereas the number of calcium bonds was minimal. After the stretching stage, the primary bonds responsible for maintaining the cheese structure were calcium bridges, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bridges.

In the Pack-alone scenario, similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words. In the Pack-and-tasting scenario, the richness of the emotional response increased when using images. In both scenarios, the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words. This could be considered an advantage, as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed. The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores.},

Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of the fluorescence landscapes exhibits four fluorophores present in the cheese, all related to the storage conditions. The chemometric analysis resolves the fluorescence signal into excitation and emission profiles of the pure fluorescent compounds, which are suggested to be tryptophan, vitamin A and a compound derived from oxidation.

abstract = {The rheological properties of mozzarella cheese were studied by using a parallel plate, a sliding plate, an extensional and a capillary rheometer over a temperature range of 25-60 °C. While mozzarella cheese behaves as a semisolid at room temperature, it behaves mostly as a liquid at higher temperatures (typically greater than 40 °C). The rheological data obtained from the various pieces of rheometers were compared. Differences among the various data sets were observed and these were demonstrated to be due to the inherent changes to the material structure during testing and to the changes in the physical properties of the cheese at different temperatures. Mozzarella cheese is a viscoelastoplastic material at room temperature, which becomes viscoelastic at about 60 °C. Its yield stress gradually decreases with increase of temperature pointing to structural changes that occur at elevated temperatures. A Herchel-Buckley viscoplastic rheological model was found to describe adequately its rheology.},

abstract = {Rheology is the study of deformation and flow of matter. Rheological behavior of milk is, in a general sense, typical of a semidilute emulsion/suspension. However, the complex composition and the microstructure of milk result in complexities in behavior not exhibited by simple systems of this kind. These complexities become more pronounced when milk is subjected to such treatments as concentration (of fat or of total solids), fractionation, homogenization, heating, renneting, and acidification during its conversion to dairy products.In this article, quantitative descriptions (mathematical models) of the fundamental rheological properties of milk, cream, concentrated milk and cream, sweetened condensed milk, dulce de leche, ice cream mix, yogurt, buttermilk, and fresh cheeses are presented. The models are of three kinds: those that relate rheological behavior to composition and microstructure, those that quantify objective properties related to texture (texture itself must be measured subjectively), and phenomenological models useful for process engineering design and other technological purposes.It is shown that though there are some general similarities between the different milk products (e.g., time-dependent shear thinning and viscoelasticity are almost ubiquitous), sensitivity of rheological properties to composition and microstructure has necessitated the development of product-specific as well as general approaches to describing rheological behavior.},

All three cheese samples showed viscoelastic, non-Newtonian and shear thinning behaviour. The fat contents were shown to affect tribological behaviour and their high-speed regimes correlated well with the bulk rheology (viscosity). The low-fat content was associated with higher friction, firmer texture and reduced spreadability of the cream cheese, due to fewer fat globules being interspersed in the protein matrix, which was confirmed from confocal images.},

abstract = {Pulsed field gradient-nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) was used to monitor the diffusion of caseins throughout the rennet coagulation of a highly concentrated casein suspension. Two types of casein species were distinguished according to their diffusing properties and attributed to the dissolved casein fraction, i.e. dissociated caseins and caseinomacropeptides (CMP), and casein particles, respectively. The NMR signal intensity coming from the dissolved casein fraction, which is related to the number of protons it contains, increased all along the experiment whereas the opposite tendency was observed for casein particles. This was explained by the increasing amount of CMP in the whey and the reciprocal loss of protons contained by casein particles, and used to quantitatively estimate the kinetics of the chymosin action. The diffusion of the dissolved casein fraction remained nearly constant during the coagulation process whereas, as revealed by rheometry measurements, the diffusion of casein particles was very sensitive to the structural reorganization of the sample. It decreased by about 35{\%} during the sol-gel transition and increased in similar proportions during the succeeding rise in gel porosity. Our results also provide different types of information on the respective behaviors of dissociated caseins and casein particles during the course of the process, the most remarkable one being that all the casein particles did not aggregate during the sol-gel transition of our sample. This strongly suggests that the rennet gelation of a concentrated dairy solution may be better visualized by the formation of a network backbone during the sol-gel transition which is thereafter reinforced upon further incorporation of casein particles.},

During manufacture, a torque profile was generated, which showed three distinctive stages; an initial torque peak "peak-1", followed by a trough and finally a second "peak-2". Analyses provided quantitative and qualitative evidence that the initial manufacturing stage (peak-1) was concerned with water uptake and the formation of a hydrated casein matrix, as ∼75{\%} of the added water was absorbed. This was followed by a fat emulsification phase (trough) and, once sufficiently emulsified, by the incorporation of the fat to form a homogeneous cheese mass, at peak-2. A similar approach showed that the effect of emulsifying salts reduction was to retard casein hydration, reflected in an increase in peak-1 torque, and led to a prolonged mixing time to sufficiently emulsify fat and allow its incorporation.},

This optimum size is the result of a compromise between (i) it being small enough to generate a high number density of non-adsorbed nano-particles, and hence a substantial osmotic pressure, and (ii) it being large enough to give a substantial depletion layer thickness. It turns out that the estimated optimum size of casein nano-particles for inducing depletion flocculation is similar to the size of small casein aggregates actually found in sodium caseinate dispersions at low ionic strength.},

abstract = {Milk was processed with high hydrostatic pressure in order to modify the casein micelles. Images, that in details showed the casein micelle structure in untreated and pressure-treated skim milk, were obtained by using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Sizes and shapes adopted by casein micelles in pressurised milk are concluded to be a result of an equilibrium distribution between self-assembling casein molecules in the serum phase and caseins adsorbed to surfaces of casein micelles and are governed by an initial pressure-dependent displacement of caseins into the serum phase. Pressurisation of milk at moderately high pressure, in the range 150-300 MPa, favoured formation of a large number of small micelles that coexisted with a fraction of large micelles, and which appeared perfectly spherical with smooth and well-defined surfaces, features which are suggested to originate from secondary adsorption of caseins. Pressurisation of milk at 400 MPa favoured formation of smaller casein assemblies, with sizes between 30 nm and 100 nm. Measurements of free calcium concentration [Ca2+] showed that calcium was rebound to casein micelles after pressurisation of milk.

abstract = {Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) methods were developed to identify fat and protein in cheeses milk chocolate and milk powders. Various fluorescent probes were assessed for their ability to label fat or protein in selected food products in situ. Dual labelling of fat and protein was made possible by using mixtures of probes. Selected probes and probe mixtures were then used to study (a) structure development of Mozzarella cheese during manufacture and ripening, and (b)) the distribution of fat and protein in milk chocolate made with milk powders containing varying levels of free fat. Microstructural changes in the protein and fat phases of Mozzarella cheese were observed at each major step in processing. Aggregation of renneted micelles occurred during curd formation; this was followed by amalgamation of the para-casein into linear fibres during plasticization. Following storage, the protein phase of the Mozzarella became more continuous; entrapping and isolating fat globules. Chocolate made with a high free-fat spray-dried powder blend showed a homogeneous fat distribution, similar to that of chocolate made with roller-dried milk. Chocolate made with whole milk powder containing 10 g free fat/100 fat showed a non-homogeneous fat distribution with some fat occluded within milk protein particles. These differences in fat distribution were related to Casson yield value and Casson viscosity of the chocolates.},

abstract = {1 INTRODUCTION Extracting exponential relaxation times and amplitudes from an NMR relaxation decay curve requires an inversion of the Laplace transform. Because the Laplace transform describes such a wide variety of physical systems, its ill-conditioned in-version has been, and continues to be, studied extensively. New publications appear frequently. Stoeps (1993) gave an excellent review of numerous approaches, and much insight into the associated problems. This review begins with a description of the governing equations in Section 2. Sec-tions 3 through 8 sort methods of constructing a solution into several general classes including: nonlinear parameter estimation of relaxation times and amplitudes of a few components, linear inverse techniques which find amplitudes on a specified grid of relaxation times, orthogonal function representations of the continuous or dis-crete formulation, linear prediction methods which encode new decay-curve points in terms of known ones, rational function approaches which exploit the form of the transform of a summation of delta-function components, and deconvolution methods which use a change of variables to convert the Laplace transform to a convolution in-tegral. Section 9 describes appraisal techniques which calculate information common to every solution reproducing the data. Various methods for quantifying resolution are also described. Unfortunately, several algorithms are not discussed here. Significant omissions include the Bayesian approach (e.g., Bretthorst, 19909, 1990b, 1990c) and maximum entropy methods (e.g., Livesey et al., 1986; Press et al., 1988). Also missing are the approximate and non-approximate noise-free techniques surveyed by Davies and Martin (1979), and the two-dimensional, joint T1 and T2 inversion of Whittall (1994). Existence, uniqueness, construction, and appraisal are four fundamentals of the analysis of the inverse Laplace transform or any other Fredhohn integral equation of the first kind. These are discussed in turn.},

abstract = {A detailed study of the concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure of sodium caseinate solutions encompassing the dilute, semi-dilute and highly concentrated regimes is presented. For the semi-dilute regime, assuming the model of sub-micelles forming 'association polymers', the data is considered in relation to the adhesive hard sphere (AHS) model and an adapted f-functional polycondensation theory. The AHS model fits reasonably at higher temperatures but is unsatisfactory at 30°C. The polycondensation theory in general provides better fits and indicates low functionality (f ca. 3) at 30°C suggesting non-centrally symmetric growth of aggregates (not within the scope of the AHS (f = ∞) model), a prediction supported by EM studies. Both models suggest small sub-micellar building blocks of diameter ca. 11 nm and aggregation number 4-5 with implicit voluminosity comparable to that of native casein sub-micelles. To represent the behaviour in the highly concentrated regime, above close packing of the sub-micelles, a rigid lattice model is proposed which suggests 'soft sphere' potentials for the sub-micelles (V(r){\~{}} r-6.75). Continuous shear rheology, contrasted with the Krieger-Dougherty hard sphere prediction, shows the expected sensitivity to aggregation at low phase volumes and to particle softness above close packing.},

Examples of such series include the growth of organisms, the concentration of a chemical reagent during a reaction occurring over time or the amount of a fossil fuel resource which has been discovered or produced as a function of time. The approach taken below differs from the usual models for this type of data in that it assumes that an unobserved time series is actually driving the process, and that the observed data series is a function of the unobserved process. In the case of fossil fuels the unobserved series might be a measure of the exploratory drilling, the number of production days in a given time period or even the amount of fiscal resources devoted to exploratory activities. A maximum likelihood method is developed for estimating the parameters of the process, especially the maximum S, and the covariance structure of the estimators is developed. The methodology is illustrated on an example of oil production. Finally, methods are developed for forecasting the data into the near future.

abstract = {There are a total of 500 (IDF, 1981) to 800 varieties of cheese. Although most cheese is consumed as “table cheese,” which may be arbitrarily defined as cheese eaten on its own or as an accompaniment to bread or crackers during meals, significant quantities of cheese are also consumed as an ingredient in cheese-based dishes/snacks in the home, food service, and prepared consumer foods. Notable examples of natural cheeses used in these applications include Cheddar, Mozzarella, and Emmental, with typical dishes including toasted sandwiches, quiche, omelettes, pasta, pizza, and lasagne. As an ingredient, pertinent attributes or functionalities of the unheated cheese include crumbliness, sliceability, spreadability, shreddability or grateability, and those of a heated cheese include overall appearance, flavor, extent of flow, stringiness, fluidity, and oiling-off. The type and level of functionality required depends upon the application. Hence, Feta cheese which is crumbly is ideal for tossed salad; Parmesan, which grates very well into small particles, for sprinkling onto lasagne or pasta dishes; and heated Mozzarella, which exhibits moderate flow and the ability to form fibrous strings when extended, for pizza. Nevertheless, the functional attributes, and, hence, suitability of any specific cheese type as an ingredient can vary due to age and degree of maturity, slight differences in make procedure and composition (such as calcium content and pH).},

abstract = {In bovine milk, and the milk from most other species, the caseins represent family of 4 gene products ($\alpha$s1-, $\alpha$s2-, $\beta$-, and $\kappa$-casein) and exhibit significant microheterogeneity due to genetic variation and posttranslational glycosylation and phosphorylation. In milk, the caseins are found predominantly in association colloids called casein micelles, which include micellar calcium phosphate that contributes to the integrity and stability of the micelles. Enzymatic destabilization of casein micelles or adjustment to their isoelectric point (pH4.6) can result in coagulation or gelation; this is the principle by which cheese or yogurt are produced. In addition, the size of micelles allows their ready recovery from milk using membrane filtration, and caseins, collectively or individually purified, are widely used as ingredients in a wide range of food applications. In this chapter, the properties of the individual caseins, the casein micelles, and properties and applications thereof are reviewed.},

The shear storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the proteinous gels and emulsion gels depended on the protein concentration. The concentration dependence of the modulus was approximated by an exponential function of the form: G ∝ Cn, n = 4 and n = 2 being found in the cases of the proteinous gels and the emulsion gels, respectively. Shear moduli of the emulsion gels were much higher than those of the proteinous gels. Gels made from a fine emulsion (containing smaller oil droplets) exhibited higher G′ and G″ values than corresponding gels from a coarse emulsion.

Texture refers to properties of foods that arise from physicochemical characteristics and which can be perceived by the human, mainly by haptic and kinesthetic stimulation. Although arising from an early classification attempt, it is still useful to distinguish between mechanical, geometrical, and mouthfeel characteristics. Each of these characteristics plays a significant but commodity-dependent role with regard to total food quality judgment by the consumer, and all are accessible by different instrumental methods. Food rheology covers methods for the instrumental determination of mechanical properties, which are based on the response of a particular food to stress or strain and its time dependency. A further classification of rheological properties can be done by considering in detail linear or nonlinear behavior toward stress, strain or shear rate responses, time-dependent behavior, or viscoelasticity.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The knowledge on the factors affecting the heat-induced physicochemical changes of milk proteins and milk pro-tein stabilized oil-in-water emulsions has been advanced for the last decade. Most of the studies have empha-sized on the understanding of how milk-protein-stabilized droplets and the non-adsorbed proteins determine the physicochemical and rheological properties of protein-concentrated dairy colloids. The physical stability of concentrated protein-stabilized emulsions (i.e., against creaming or phase separation/gelation after heat treat-ment) can be modulated by carefully controlling the colloidal properties of the protein-stabilized droplets and the non-adsorbed proteins in the aqueous phase. This article focusses on the review of the physical stability of concentrated milk protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions as influenced by physicochemical factors, interpar-ticle interactions (i.e., protein–protein, and droplet–droplet interactions) and processing conditions. Emphasis has been given to the recent advances in the formation, structure and physical stability of oil-in-water emulsions prepared with all types of milk proteins, reviewing in particular the impact of pre-and post-homogenization heat treatments. In addition, the importance of common components found in the continuous phase of heat-treated nutritional emulsions that can promote aggregation (polymers, sugars, minerals) will be highlighted. Finally, the routes of manipulating the steric stabilization of these emulsions to control heat-induced aggregation—through protein–surfactant, protein–protein, protein–polysaccharide interactions and through the incorporation of protein based colloidal particles—are reviewed.},
annote = {wonderful review paper which explains our phenomenon of increasing protein concentration at the interface. proteins are either transported to the interface within a submicellar structure or, submicelles are formed at the interface.
{\ss}-Cas from NaCas tends to form Micelles at high concentrations, that might be the reason why we cant find it in high concentration at the interface.

This means: Increased Protein concentration at the interface doesn't mean that the oil droplets are emulsified stronger but rather held in better by a thicker protein layer out of submicelles on the interface.

When MC and Dissociated Caseins are present, there is a competitive adsorption and the Size of the layer thickness decreases. For our system and the step-wise structure build up this means that submicelles are the predominating factor. maybe, we don't have "free" caseinates but just submicelles.

abstract = {The aim of this work was to determine the effect and magnitude of fat droplet clustering on the rheological properties of emulsion-filled gels. To this end, we investigated experimentally the effect of fat hardness and emulsion droplet clustering in gelatin gels. Fat droplet clustering was induced or avoided by changing the temperature at which the emulsion was mixed with the gelatin. Rheological properties of the filled gels were investigated by uniaxial compression. The obtained experimental data show that next to changes in droplet hardness and matrix hardness, also droplet clustering contributes to the gel stiffness; even in the absence of discrete bonds between adjacent droplets. The experimental data was compared with the Kerner model, the Kerner model corrected by the effective volume fraction approach and the Kerner model considering an inhomogeneous distribution of the droplets. The Kerner model gives a good prediction for the gels filled with liquid droplets without clustering. The correction for an inhomogeneous distribution of the droplets best described the influence of emulsion droplet clustering in emulsion-filled gels, showing a quantitative evaluation on the role of droplet clustering in the rheological behaviour of emulsion-filled gels. This may provide guidelines for developing a strategy to control certain product properties.},

abstract = {The adsorption data presented in the preceding paper (Part II of this series) have been used to deduce the molecular structures of $\beta$-casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lysozyme films at the air-water and oil-water interfaces. The hydrophobic, disordered $\beta$-casein molecules are more surface-active than the globular BSA and lysozyme molecules. $\beta$-Casein is in an all-train configuration at low surface pressures ($\pi$ {\textless} 8 mN m−1) at the air-water interface and can be described by Singer's equation of state for linear polymers. At higher $\pi$ values, loop formation ensues, and the loops increase in density at the expense of the trains until in the close-packed, condensed state the ratio of amino acid residues in loop and train configurations is about 2:1. This conformational change does not occur at the oil-water interface because loops already form at low $\pi$; enhanced loop formation in the nonaqueous phase is favored because oil molecules solvate the hydrophobic residues. Multilayer formation occurs at high substrate protein concentrations ({\textgreater} 10−2 wt{\%}) giving films thicker than 100 {\AA}. Although the primary layer is irreversibly adsorbed, molecules in subsequent layers are reversibly adsorbed. Lysozyme molecules are denatured at low $\pi$ values ($\pi$ {\textless} 8 mN m−1), and at higher values essentially native molecules (which are reversibly adsorbed) coexist in the surface film. Much residual native structure remains even in the denatured film because lysozyme is very resistant to denaturation. At the oil-water interface, the adsorbed lysozyme molecules are denatured to a greater extent than those at the air-water interface; native molecules are not stable at this interface. The adsorbed BSA molecules contain residual native structure, but there is no abrupt conformational change in the film at a particular packing density. The structure at the air-water interface is intermediate to those of lysozyme and $\beta$-casein. BSA has the same $\pi$-A curve as lysozyme at the oil-water interface.},

These conditions were chosen to replicate those experienced by the cheese during pizza baking and consumption. The extensional viscosity measurements were carried out by means of hyperbolic contraction flow, an alternative method to traditional extensional measurements. The extensional viscosity measured by hyperbolic contraction flow was related to the cheese elasticity and consequently to its stretchability, a major quality characteristic when this is consumed on pizza pies. The rheology of the two cheese materials could be explained by the structural observations made by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).},

abstract = {New process steps in the production of fresh cheese were introduced and varied in order to reduce the undesirable phenomenon of syneresis without adding milk-foreign additives. Native and modified whey protein concentrates (WPC) with approx. 12{\%} protein were used as ingredients in the production of fresh cheese spreads. During production the fresh cheese samples were submitted to an extra flow-induced mechanical stress. The aim of the present study is to detect changes of the water-holding capacity of different treated fresh cheese by means of the non-destructive low resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (LR NMR). Furthermore, a newly developed measuring method based on NMR, the so-called wash-out-test, was implemented in order to simulate syneresis of fresh cheese. The obtained data were correlated with the results of the viscosity and the firmness of the samples. Syneresis data were determined by decanting experiments as a function of the storage duration. The present study shows that the shearing procedure during processing has an influence on the viscosity of the final product, its firmness and the syneresis behaviour of the fresh cheese samples. The main result is that good syneresis properties seem to be correlated with a softer mechanical consistency of the products. The presented data indicate that NMR measurements and, especially, wash-out-tests are useful techniques to characterise the water-holding capacity (WHC) and the structure of differently treated fresh cheese samples. Based on this knowledge concerning the microscopic and macroscopic material behaviour, it is possible to improve the production processing and the final, consumer-relevant properties of fresh cheese products. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The current contribution discusses the structure analysis of a solid multicomponent food product (which is in this case dark chocolate) using microtomography. The material consists of a continuous solid lipid phase, in which particles are suspended. A detailed analysis of the microstructure is needed to understand migration processes, which are e.g. responsible for major problems in the confectionery industry such as chocolate blooming. In this study it was possible to clearly distinguish the particles from the continuous phase. Particle arrangement and structural imperfections within the sample were made visible by using synchrotron radiation. The observed imperfections, which arise during the manufacturing process, might act as migration pathways, since they propagate throughout the entire sample. The captured microtomographic images proof the presence of cracks and voids within a common industrial made chocolate. Future research has to show if migration is happen along the identified microstructural defects.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Manufacture of cream cheese involves the formation of an initial acid-induced gel made from high-fat milk, followed by a series of processing steps including shearing, heating, and dewatering that complete the conversion of the acid gel into a complex cheese product. We investigated 2 critical parameters for their effect on the initial gel: homogenization pressure (HP) of the high-fat cheese milk, and fermentation temperature (FT). The impact of a low (10 MPa) and high (25 MPa) HP, and low (20°C) and high (26°C) FT were investigated for their effects on rheological and textural properties of acid-induced gels. Intact acid gels were sheared and heated to 80°C, and then their rheological properties were analyzed to help understand the effect of shearing/heating processes on the gel characteristics. The effect of HP on fat globule size distribution and the amount of protein not involved in emulsion droplets (i.e., in the bulk phase) were also studied. For cream cheese trials, a central composite experimental design was used to explore the effect of these 2 parameters (HP and FT) on the texture, rheology, and sensory properties of experimentally manufactured cream cheese. Storage modulus (G′) and hardness values of cream cheeses were obtained from small amplitude oscillatory rheology tests and texture profile analysis, respectively. Quantitative spectrum descriptive sensory analysis was also performed. Consistency of acid gels (measured using a penetration test) increased with an increase in FT and with an increase in HP. Although stiffer acid-induced gels were formed at high FT, after the heating and shearing processes the apparent viscosity of the samples formed at high FT was lower than those formed at low FT. For the cream cheeses, significant prediction models were obtained for several rheological and textural attributes. The G′ values at 8°C, instrumental hardness, and sensory firmness attributes were significantly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.84); all these attributes significantly decreased with an increase in FT, and HP was not a significant parameter in the prediction models developed for these attributes. Significant interactions were observed between the HP and FT terms for these prediction models. Higher HP increased the amount of protein adsorbed at interface of fat globules but decreased bulk phase protein content (which may be important for crosslinking this gelled emulsion system). At higher FT temperature, coarser gel networks were likely formed. The combined effect of a coarser acid gel network at high FT, and less bulk phase casein available for crosslinking the acidified emulsion gel with an increase in HP, could have contributed to the lower stiffness/firmness observed in cream cheese made under conditions of both high FT and high HP. Stickiness of cream cheese greatly increased under conditions of high FT and high HP, whereas the sensory attributes cohesiveness of mass and difficulty to dissolve decreased. This study helped to better understand the complex relationships between the initial acid-induced gel phase and properties of the (final) cream cheese.},

abstract = {NMR relaxation data and those from many other physical measurements are sums of exponentially decaying components, combined with some unavoidable measurement noise. When decay data are inverted in order to give quasi-continuous distributions of relaxation times, some smoothing of the distributions is normally implemented to avoid excess variation. When the same distribution has a sharp peak and a much broader peak or a "tail," as for many porous media saturated with liquids, an inversion program using a fixed smoothing coefficient may broaden the sharp peak and/ or break the wide peak or tail into several separate peaks, even if the coefficient is adaptively chosen in accord with the noise level of the data. We deal with this problem by using variable smoothing, determined by iterative feedback in such a way that the smoothing penalty is roughly constant. This uniform-penalty (UP) smoothing can give sharp lines, not broadened more than is consistent with the noise, and in the same distribution it can show a tail decades long without breaking it up into several peaks. The noise level must be known approximately, but it can be determined more than adequately by a preliminary inversion. The same iterative procedure is used to implement constraints such as non-negative (NN) or monotonic-from-peak (MT). The significance of an additional resolved peak may be tested by finding the cost of using MT to force a uni modal solution. A bimodal constraint can be applied. Decay data representing sharp lines in contact with broad features can require substantial computing time and some controls to stabilize the iterative sequence. However, UP can be made to function smoothly for a very wide variety of decay curves, which can be processed without adjustment of parameters, including the dimensionless smoothing parameters. Extensive testing has been done with artificial data. Examples are shown for artificial data, biological tissues, ceramic technology, and sandstones. Expressions are given relating noise level to line width and for significance of increase or decrease in error of fit. {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

Incorporation of this novel vaccine into the US vaccination schedule will require demonstration of a lack of immunologic interference with other routine pediatric vaccines. This study assessed the immune response to 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus vaccine (DTaP-HepB-IPV) when separately co-administered with HibMenCY-TT as compared to a US-licensed H. influenzae type b tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Hib-TT) at 2, 4, 6 (N=606) and 12-15 months of age (N=366). HibMenCY-TT was non-inferior to Hib-TT in terms of antibody responses to all Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in PCV7 and the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and poliovirus antigens contained in DTaP-HepB-IPV one month after the third vaccine dose, and the anti-tetanus geometric mean antibody concentration (GMC) was significantly higher in the HibMenCY-TT group than in the Hib-TT group. In an exploratory analysis, no significant differences in the proportion of subjects with anti-pneumococcal antibody concentrations 0.2 µg/ml or anti-pneumococcal GMC were seen between the two groups after the fourth vaccine dose. A schedule of HibMenCY-TT given concomitantly with PCV7 and DTaP-HepB-IPV would be expected to protect infants against all of the targeted diseases.},

The addition of CaCl2 (5 or 8mM) prior to homogenization was found to enhance greatly the stability of these emulsions (6wt.{\%} protein+10vol.{\%} oil or 4wt.{\%} protein+35vol.{\%} oil). Shear rheological measurements on pseudoplastic emulsions with no added calcium displayed increasing apparent viscosity with time. In contrast, identical emulsions with added Ca2+ (5 or 8mM) were low-viscosity Newtonian liquids. Optical microscopy confirmed that calcium-free emulsions containing unadsorbed caseinate were flocculated whereas those containing 5 or 8mM Ca2+ were not. The enhanced creaming and shear-thinning rheology of the emulsions without added calcium is attributed to depletion flocculation by unbound caseinate sub-micelles. It is proposed that addition of Ca2+ results in association of sub-micelles into larger aggregates which, owing to their large size (similar to casein micelles in milk), are incapable of inducing depletion flocculation.

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are under intense analysis due to their structural flexibility and importance in biological functions. Minuscule modulation in the microenvironment induces significant conformational changes in IDPs, and these non-native conformations of the IDPs often induce aggregation and cause cell death. Changes in the membrane composition often change the microenvironment, which promote conformational change and aggregation of IDPs. $\kappa$-Casein, an important milk protein, belongs to the class of IDPs containing net negative charges. In this present work, we have studied the interaction of $\kappa$-casein with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), a positively charged surfactant, utilizing various steady state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results clearly indicate that $\kappa$-casein undergoes at least two conformational transitions in presence of various concentrations of CTAB. The intrinsically disordered $\kappa$-casein assumes a partially folded conformation at lower concentration of CTAB, which adopts an unstructured conformation at higher concentration of CTAB. The partially folded conformation of $\kappa$-casein at a lower CTAB concentration might be induced by the favorable electrostatic interaction between the positively charged surfactant headgroup and net negative charges of the protein, whereas surfactant nature of CTAB is being pronounced at higher concentration of CTAB.},

abstract = {The large deformation properties of gelatine, $\kappa$-carrageenan and whey protein isolate (WPI) gels filled with bound and unbound oil droplets were studied as a function of compression speed. The rheological properties of the gel matrices controlled the compression speed-dependency of the gels containing oil droplets. Polymer gels (gelatine and $\kappa$-carrageenan gels) showed a predominantly elastic behaviour. Their Young's modulus was not affected by the compression speed. The increase of fracture stress and strain observed with increasing compression speed was related to friction between the structural elements of the gels and, for gelatine, to the unzipping of physical bonds. Particle gels (WPI gels) showed a more viscoelastic behavior. Their Young's modulus and fracture stress increased with compression speed. This was attributed to the viscous flow of the matrix and friction phenomena between structural elements of the gel. The effect of an increase in the oil volume fraction ($\phi$) on the Young's modulus was for all gels according to the Van der Poel theory. In addition, oil droplets embedded in the gel matrix acted as stress concentration nuclei and increased friction. The relative impact of these two effects was related to the viscoelastic properties of the gels and to droplet-matrix interaction. For polymer gels and gels with bound droplets, stress concentration phenomena played a relatively larger role. For particle gels and gels with unbound droplets, friction phenomena were relatively more important, increasing the viscoelastic character of the gels. As a result, an increase in $\phi$ resulted in a decrease of both fracture stress and fracture strain for polymer gels and in an increase of the fracture stress and a decrease of fracture strain for particle gels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For an isolated spin, quantum mechanics allows only transitions between adjacent levels. It is noted that the dipolar relaxation rate is be highly dependent upon the gyromagnetic ratios of the interacting nuclei. It is found that in addition to the direct dipolar coupling of nuclear magnetic moments, there can also be indirect interactions between nuclei, which are mediated via the bonding electrons. This effect is called spin–spin or scalar coupling and can lead to fine structure in the resonance signals. A number of NMR techniques have also been applied to probe the orientational order and the molecular mobility of the phospholipid molecules in bilayers. {\textcopyright} 1982, Academic Press Inc.},

However, these relationships can be difficult to determine due to the complex composition, structure of the food, as well as the difficulties in accounting for the changes to the food during oral processing. Novel rheological and sensorial analyses are working toward a better understanding of food structural breakdown, bolus development, and the associated properties and attributes of the food as it undergoes these changes. These analyses are uncovering some of the key unknown information about food behaviors during oral processing, allowing progression toward a universal set of rheological–sensory relationships.},

abstract = {Selected influencing factors in processed cheese making (protein and fat content, fat globule size, and rework addition) affecting the physical changes known as “creaming” were investigated for their effect on this multistage structure formation reaction. The creaming curve (viscosity vs. time) shows four typical stages: an initiation phase, a first exponential stage, a plateau, and a second exponential phase. Increasing the protein content from 10 to 17{\%} (w/w) accelerated the reaction. Light microscopy showed that the fat content (0–20{\%}) affected the shape of the creaming curve as well and it was shown that a fat level of 15–20{\%} is required for the characteristic creaming curve to occur. Moreover, modifications in the initial milkfat globule size (3.7 $\mu$m down to 1.1 $\mu$m) by means of upstream homogenization (0–250/50 bar) accelerated the exponential phase and modified the shape of the creaming curve, shortening the initiation and plateau phases. The reaction started earlier with decreasing incoming fat globule size, and the slope was steeper. When fat was present in the system, it was not only the content, but the milkfat globule size which dictates the viscosity change and shape of the curve. The addition of rework dramatically affects the structure formation process, rework probably acting as a catalyst accelerating the reaction. However, protein polymerization was found to be constant during the entire course of the reaction suggesting that weaker physical bonds are responsible for the structuring of the matrix.},

Then, by applying a stepwise solvent exchange procedure via an intermediate solvent, full replacement of the internal aqueous phase within the protein matrix by sunflower oil was achieved. The solvent exchange procedure was performed by using either acetone or tetrahydrofuran (THF) as intermediate solvent. The oil inside the protein matrix was homogeneously distributed without any noticeable damage to the structure. Analyzing the weight change of the protein gel as a result of the solvent exchange shows that the oil holding capacity depends on the microstructure, the polarity of the intermediate solvent, and the kinetics of the solvent exchange. Depending on the gel microstructure and protein concentration of the preceding hydrogel, the oil content in the oleogels was found to be as high as 91 wt {\%}. Oil holding capacity correlated we...},

Furthermore, the hardest samples were those manufactured from DSP and TSPP in a ratio 1:1. This ratio resulted in processed cheese with the highest values of gel strength and interaction factor. When TSC was utilized in the mixtures, the hardness of the samples rose with the increase of P20 (≥50{\%}). Additionally, when DSP, TSC, TSPP, and P20 were added as sole ingredients, hardness decreased in the following order: P20 {\textgreater} TSPP ≈ TSC {\textgreater} DSP. This trend was also observed with the values of gel strength and interaction factor. The hardness of all samples increased with increased storage periods.

For both systems, large changes were observed in the 1/l* parameter before any marked increase in particle size, indicating a partial correlation between particles which increased as the pH dropped (for the milk case) and with each addition of pectin (for the emulsion case). Theoretical calculations of l* were made assuming no correlation between particles (S(q)=1) and compared to the experimentally-obtained 1/l* values. Without interparticle interactions the value of 1/l* remained essentially constant throughout. This indicates that the change observed experimentally is primarily due to a change in S(q) and that 1/l* is a good indication of system order. Finally, it is noted that the opacity of a gel is mainly determined by the initial properties of the dispersed particles. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rheology of cheese characterizes its deformation behavior when subjected to stress or strain. The rheological behavior of cheese can be measured by an array of tests. Some tests, for example creep and low-strain oscillation rheometry, involve application of strains within the linear viscoelastic limit and yield intrinsic rheological quantities such as storage modulus and elastic creep compliance. These tests are also useful in characterizing cheese as a viscoelastic material exhibiting the properties of ideal solids and liquids. Other tests employ strains outside the viscoelastic range such as large strain compression or torsion gelometry and yield quantities (e.g., fracture stress, fracture strain, and/or hardness) that are more empirical but which simulate the stresses and strains encountered during consumption and commercial size-reduction operations (including shredding and grinding). The rheological characteristics of cheese are controlled by its macrostructure, microstructure, composition, and internal environment (e.g., pH, temperature). The primary structural component controlling the deformation of cheese for a given stress is the protein matrix, with its concentration and degree of proteolysis and hydration being critical.},

abstract = {Least-squares and linear programming algorithms for the interpretation of NMR relaxation data in terms of a spectrum of relaxation times are presented. These stable methods are noniterative and avoid all of the difficulties associated with nonlinear optimization schemes. Moreover, they are not restricted by any assumptions which limit the number of possible relaxation times. The inherent nonuniqueness due to the finite number of inaccurate measurements means that a variety of discrete and continuous spectra exist which fit the data equally well. For a complete interpretation the range of possible solutions must be examined. The algorithms discussed explore the space of acceptable solutions by constructing relaxation spectra from a continuum of models ranging from a few isolated delta functions to a continuous distribution. Alternatively, the interpreter can choose that class of spectrum (discrete or continuous) which best represents the physical system under investigation and so enhance the reliability of the interpretation. This flexibility is essential in order to avoid the pitfalls of interpreting a single spectrum returned by a single algorithm. In addition, the linear programming approach reduces the non-uniqueness by constructing unique information in the form of bounds on all spectra which satisfy the observations. These bounds and the corresponding extreme models are necessary for any quantitative determination of how spectral peaks change in amplitude or position with a change in the physical system.0 1989 Academic Press, Inc. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The self-diffusion coefficients of different molecular weight PEGs (Polyethylene glycol) and casein particles were measured, using a pulsed-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance technique (PFG-NMR), in native phosphocaseinate (NPC) and sodium caseinate (SC) dispersions where caseins are not structured into micelles. The dependence of the PEG self-diffusion coefficient on the PEG size, casein concentration, the size and the mobility of casein obstacle particles are reported. Wide differences in the PEG diffusion coefficients were found according to the casein particle structure. The greatest reduction in diffusion coefficients was found in sodium caseinate suspensions. Moreover, sodium caseinate aggregates were found to diffuse more slowly than casein micelles for casein concentrations {\textgreater}9 g/100 g H2O. Experimental PEG and casein diffusion findings were analyzed using two appropriate diffusion models: the Rouse model and the Speedy model, respectively. According to the Speedy model, caseins behave as hard spheres below the close packing limit (10 g/100 g H2O for SC (Farrer {\&} Lips, 1999) and 15 g/100 g H2O for NPC (Bouchoux et al., 2009)) and as soft particles above this limit. Our results provided a consistent picture of the effects of diffusant mass, the dynamics of the host material and of the importance of the casein structure in determining the diffusion behavior of probes in these systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the impact on the texture properties of emulsion-filled gels when saturated solid fat is replaced by unsaturated liquid oil. Whey protein aggregate, gelatin and micellar casein, were chosen to form different types of gel matrices and the fat hardness was varied by selection of the fat type and variation of the temperature. As emulsifier, either whey protein aggregates, whey protein or sodium caseinate was used. Texture properties of the filled gels were investigated by uniaxial compression. The fracture properties were affected by the presence of emulsion droplets, however the effect of fat hardness was small. The presence of emulsion droplets (either liquid or solid) increases the gel stiffness as compared to the emulsion-free gel, indicating that the droplets are an active part of the gel. An increase in solid fat content led to a moderate increase in gel stiffness for whey protein aggregate gels, which was in agreement with predictions according to the Palierne model for the effect of fat hardness on the stiffness of the filled gels. For the gelatin and micellar casein gels, the magnitude by which the gel stiffness increased as a function of the solid fat content was much larger than expected on the basis of this model. Microscopical observation suggested that this was caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of the fat droplets, due to droplet aggregation or/and concentration of the droplets in gel strands, which increases the effective volume fraction of the droplets in the matrix.},

The physicochemical composition, texture profile, degree of casein dissociation, fat particle size, color, and nuclear magnetic resonance profile (NMR) of processed cheese were determined. Hardness, degree of casein dissociation, and pH increased as the concentration of emulsifying salts increased. The fat particle size of processed cheese was significantly influenced by the type of emulsifying salts, with processed cheese made with sodium hexametaphosphate having larger particles (4.68 $\mu$m) than cheeses made with the other salts (from 2.71 to 3.30 $\mu$m). The processed cheese prepared with trisodium citrate was whiter than those prepared with the other emulsifying salts. The NMR analysis showed that the relaxation time of processed cheese of 10 to 100 ms accounted for a major proportion, indicating that the moisture in processed cheese was mainly bound water combined with the fat globule and hydrated casein. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract = {The rheology of cheese characterizes its deformation behavior when subjected to stress or strain. The rheological behavior of cheese can be measured by an array of tests. Some tests, for example creep and low-strain oscillation rheometry, involve application of strains within the linear viscoelastic limit and yield intrinsic rheological quantities such as storage modulus and elastic creep compliance. These tests are also useful in characterizing cheese as a viscoelastic material exhibiting the properties of ideal solids and liquids. Other tests employ strains outside the viscoelastic range such as large strain compression or torsion gelometry and yield quantities (e.g., fracture stress, fracture strain, and/or hardness) that are more empirical but which simulate the stresses and strains encountered during consumption and commercial size-reduction operations (including shredding and grinding). The rheological characteristics of cheese are controlled by its macrostructure, microstructure, composition, and internal environment (e.g., pH, temperature). The primary structural component controlling the deformation of cheese for a given stress is the protein network, with its concentration and degree of proteolysis and hydration being critical.},

abstract = {The aggregation of proteins is of fundamental relevance in a number of daily phenomena, as important and diverse as blood coagulation, medical diseases, or cooking an egg in the kitchen. Colloidal food systems, in particular, are examples that have great significance for protein aggregation, not only for their importance and implications, which touches on everyday life, but also because they allow the limits of the colloidal science analogy to be tested in a much broader window of conditions, such as pH, ionic strength, concentration and temperature. Thus, studying the aggregation and self-assembly of proteins in foods challenges our understanding of these complex systems from both the molecular and statistical physics perspectives. Last but not least, food offers a unique playground to study the aggregation of proteins in three, two and one dimensions, that is to say, in the bulk, at air/water and oil/water interfaces and in protein fibrillation phenomena. In this review we will tackle this very ambitious task in order to discuss the current understanding of protein aggregation in the framework of foods, which is possibly one of the broadest contexts, yet is of tremendous daily relevance.},

Meltability generally decreased, whereas textural properties such as hardness, adhesiveness, viscosity and density increased with increasing protein concentrations. In general, partial replacement of milk fat with inulin increased meltability, density, cohesiveness and viscosity (the latter only for 1{\%} inulin), but it decreased sample hardness and adhesiveness. At the first stage of heating, the values of storage and loss moduli decreased with an increase in temperature, but increased at {\textgreater}41 °C in cheese analogues, in particular in products with lower milk fat levels and higher inulin content. All of the tested samples exhibited good melting properties. The addition of inulin to cheese samples did not influence their water activity, but altered their color. Confocal microscopy revealed that the highest hardness values could be attributed to more intense distribution of fat droplets in the sample with the highest fat content. Our results suggest that milk fat in processed cheese analogues can be partially replaced with inulin to improve the functional properties of the final product.},

The type and the amount of protein present in the continuous phase and at the oilewater interface are crucial in the design of emulsions with appropriate stability. In this study, four oil-in-water model emulsion systems (pH 6.8 e7.0) were formulated, characterised and categorised according to the potential interactions between protein-coated or surfactant-coated emulsion droplets and non-adsorbed proteins present in the continuous phase. The heat stability, the creaming behaviour and the flow behaviour of the model emulsions were influenced by both the emulsifier type and the type of protein in the continuous phase. The results suggest that this stability map approach of predicting dropletedroplet, dropleteprotein and proteineprotein interactions will be useful for the future design of heat-stable emulsion-based beverages with good creaming stability at high protein concentrations.},

abstract = {Many food products can be categorized as emulsion gels. This is especially the case for protein-based oil-in-water emulsions which can be converted into soft-solid-like materials by common food processing operations such as heating, acidification, and enzyme action. This review article outlines how the rheological and structural properties of protein-stabilized emulsion gels are influenced by the dispersed oil volume fraction, the oil-water interfacial composition, and the colloidal interactions of the constituent emulsion droplets. For model systems of variable oil content and containing different food proteins, some general trends of rheological behaviour at small and large deformations are identified. Experimental rigidity data are considered in relation to: (i) material science theories of the reinforcement of solid materials by active and inactive filler particles, and (ii) Brownian dynamics simulations of aggregated particle networks containing bonded and non-bonded particles. Influences of interfacial composition and particle-matrix interactions on microstructure and rheology are explained with particular reference to the role of small-molecule surfactants. Compositional and structural factors affecting the large-deformation rheology and fracture properties are described. Finally, the practical relevance of the model system studies to the behaviour of real food products is critically assessed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Higher fat content had a similar effect. The second model only considered samples without added stabilisers, identifying fat and protein to be the fundamental factors that contained syneresis. Aligning with model 1, the third model only considered samples with stabilisers, confirming salt to be the influencing parameter to decrease serum release showing the dominating effect of hydrocolloids on syneresis in cream cheese. $\zeta$-Potential and pH had no significant effect.

abstract = {Cosolutes excluded from macromolecules create effective attractions between the excluding macromolecules, and promote their self-association. This "depletion force" serves an important stabilizing role in many biological and technological processes. Specifically, many osmolytes and polymeric crowders that are excluded from protein surfaces stabilize the more compact folded state. Yet, these excluded cosolutes operate through several, thermodynamically distinct, mechanisms. Here we review the experimentally found mechanisms and link these to possible underlying molecular interactions. One class of excluded cosolutes comprises protective osmolytes. These tend to induce attractive depletion forces that are enthalpically dominated but entropically destabilizing. Whereas polymeric crowders may act by similar mechanisms to osmolytes, in many other cases they induce depletion forces dominated by favorable entropy. These different thermodynamic mechanisms are intimately related to the effective interaction of cosolute with each macromolecule. The venerable Asakura-Oosawa model for depletion forces assumes that the cosolute-macromolecule interaction is entirely steric, thereby predicting fully entropic depletion forces. Augmenting this steric repulsion core with a "soft" repulsion shell adds an enthalpic contribution to the depletion force, which may even dominate all other contributions. Further, considering that cosolute-macromolecule effective interactions are temperature-dependent results in a depletion force that can be concertedly dominated by enthalpy and entropically disfavored, as observed experimentally for protective osmolytes. In this core-shell description, to account for depletion forces that are enthalpically dominated and entropically disfavored, it is sufficient to consider an effective microscopic cosolute-macromolecule soft shell that comprises an entropic attraction and an enthalpic repulsion. We show how the full gamut of cosolute effects can be rationalized using these simple considerations regarding the nature of the cosolute-macromolecule effective interaction.},

We determine size measures such as the gyration radius Rg and the hydrodynamic radii RH, and obtain the estimates for the size ratio Rg/ RH with its dependence on the functionality f= fc+ fr of grafted polymers. In particular, we obtain the quantitative estimate of the degree of compactification of these polymers with increasing number of closed loops fr as compared to linear or star-shape molecules of the same total molecular weight. Numerical simulations corroborate theoretical prediction that Rg/ RH decreases towards unity with increasing f.

Casein micelles are remarkably heat-stable in milk below the boiling point, but they aggregate when heated at lower temperatures after lowering the pH or adding calcium ions. Here the literature on gelation of casein micelle suspensions induced by heating below 90 °C is reviewed. First the effect of the protein concentration, pH and the mineral composition is considered for model aqueous casein micelle suspensions. Then we examine the influence of whey proteins on heat-induced gelation of casein micelle suspensions and finally we review the literature on heat-induced gelation of reconstituted skim milk.}

We demonstrate in vitro construction of engineered steak-like tissue assembled of three types of bovine cell fibers (muscle, fat, and vessel). Because actual meat is an aligned assembly of the fibers connected to the tendon for the actions of contraction and relaxation, tendon-gel integrated bioprinting was developed to construct tendon-like gels. In this study, a total of 72 fibers comprising 42 muscles, 28 adipose tissues, and 2 blood capillaries were constructed by tendon-gel integrated bioprinting and manually assembled to fabricate steak-like meat with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 10 mm inspired by a meat cut. The developed tendon-gel integrated bioprinting here could be a promising technology for the fabrication of the desired types of steak-like cultured meats.},

abstract = {The emulsion stability and rheological properties of heated (120 °C, 0–60 min) 30{\%} w/w oil-in-water emulsions (droplet diameter ∼ 0.73 $\mu$m, pH 6.8) containing sodium caseinate (Na-CN), 2–6{\%} w/w, were investigated. The creaming kinetics, determined by multiple light scattering (Turbiscan), showed that the phase separation of Na-CN-stabilized emulsions was markedly dependent on the duration of the heat treatment. The differences between unheated and heated emulsions were attributed to heat-induced physicochemical changes in the aqueous Na-CN nanoparticles. The heat treatment caused protein degradation and changed the intact Na-CN concentration in the continuous phase. The emulsion structures, with varied extents of depletion flocculation, were well reflected by small and large deformation rheology. In the recombined Na-CN emulsions, the depletion attraction was weakened at low and moderate Na-CN concentrations (2{\%} and 4{\%} w/w) but was strengthened at high Na-CN concentration (6{\%} w/w). The former structural change was predominantly due to reduced depletion attraction, whereas reduced depletion attraction and decreased continuous phase viscosity influenced the latter structural change. The intact Na-CN concentration in the continuous phase is determined by the heat-induced physicochemical changes of Na-CN nanoparticles, which played a significant role in the physical stability of the emulsions. The insights from this study can be used to create novel droplet sizes and protein particle sizes to manipulate the droplet/protein size ratio, and therefore the extent of droplet−droplet interactions.},

abstract = {Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins underlies the formation of membrane-less organelles. While it has been recognized for some time that these organelles are of key importance for normal cellular functions, a growing number of recent observations indicate that LLPS may also play a role in disease. In particular, numerous proteins that form toxic aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease, were found to be highly prone to phase separation, suggesting that there might be a strong link between LLPS and the pathogenic process in these disorders. This review aims to assess the molecular basis of this link through exploration of the intermolecular interactions that underlie LLPS and aggregation and the underlying mechanisms facilitating maturation of liquid droplets into more stable assemblies, including so-called labile fibrils, hydrogels, and pathological amyloids. Recent insights into the structural basis of labile fibrils and potential mechanisms by which these relatively unstable structures could transition into more stable pathogenic amyloids are also discussed. Finally, this review explores how the environment of liquid droplets could modulate protein aggregation by altering kinetics of protein self-association, affecting folding of protein monomers, or changing aggregation pathways.},

Cryo-SEM produced high-resolution images making the measurement of fat globule size possible, whereas ESEM images allowed detailed visualisation of the protein matrix. FT-IR imaging and LM were both useful in specifically distinguishing the different components of the cheese. Starch type greatly influenced cheese microstructure. Resistant starch did not gelatinise and the intact starch particles were observed to have little interaction with the protein matrix, whereas pre-gelatinised and native corn starch gelatinised during cheese manufacture at 80 °C, and so interacted more with the protein matrix. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Both in individual and their binary mixtures, addition of Ca and Mg resulted in increase in $\beta$-sheet structures and decrease in triple helices and turns, implying binding of cations to similar sites. Binding of cations with phosphoseryl clusters with loop-helix-loop motifs explained the reduction in helical element. In addition, the binding of cations to electronegative regions reduced electrostatic repulsion, resulting in an increase in hydrophobic interactions accounting for increase in sheet structures. Compared with Mg, it seemed that Ca had more affinity for caseins, especially when they were in a binary mixture.

abstract = {Protein aggregation is an important phenomenon that alternatively is part of the normal functioning of nature or, central to this review, has negative consequences via its hypothesized central role in neurodegenerative diseases. A key to controlling protein aggregation is understanding the mechanism(s) of protein aggregation. Kinetic studies, data curve-fitting, and analysis are, in turn, keys to rigorous mechanistic studies. The main goal of this review is to analyze and report on the primary literature contributions to protein aggregation kinetics, mechanism, and curve-fitting. Following a brief introduction, the multiple different physical methods that have been employed to follow protein aggregation are presented and briefly discussed. Next, key information on the starting proteins and especially the products, and any detectable intermediates, involved in protein aggregation are presented. This is followed by tabulation (in the Supporting information) and discussion (in the main text), of the many approaches in the literature striving to determine the kinetics and mechanism of protein aggregation. It is found that these approaches can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) kinetic and thermodynamic, (ii) empirical, and (iii) other approaches. The first two approaches are the main focus of the present contribution, their goal being curve-fitting the available kinetic data and obtaining quantitative rate constants characterizing the nucleation, growth, and any other parts of the overall aggregation process. The large literature of protein aggregation is distilled down to five classes of postulated mechanisms: i) the subsequent monomer addition mechanism, ii) the reversible association mechanism, iii) prion aggregation mechanisms, iv) an "Ockham's razor"/minimalistic model first presented in 1997 and known as the Finke-Watzky 2-step model, and v) quantitative structure activity relationship models. These five classes of mechanisms are reviewed in detail in historical order; where possible corresponding kinetic equations, and fits to aggregation data via the proposed mechanisms, are analyzed and discussed. The five classes of mechanisms are then analyzed and discussed in terms of their similarities and differences to one another. Also included is a brief discussion of selected empirical approaches used to investigate protein aggregation. Three problem areas in the protein aggregation kinetic and mechanistic studies area are identified, and a Summary and Conclusions section is provided en route to moving the field forward towards the still unachieved goal of unequivocal elucidation of the mechanism(s) of protein aggregation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Addition of NaCl before and after homogenization had no significant effect on average size of emulsion droplets in all emulsion systems studied. In emulsions made with 1 or 3{\%} (w/w) caseinate, addition of NaCl up to 40 mM resulted in an increase in surface protein concentration (mg/m2) which appeared to be due largely to the enhanced adsorption of $\alpha$(s1)-casein at the droplet surface, particularly in emulsions formed with 1{\%} caseinate. Emulsion formed with 3{\%} caseinate in the absence of NaCl showed extensive flocculation of emulsion droplets that resulted in very low creaming stability.

Based on the review of the Rayleigh resolution limit and Abbe's theory of the microscope two distinct strategies can be distinguished: The first uses suitable encoding methods to increase the signal bandwidth passed through the imaging system at the expense of other system parameters. The second strategy exploits the Fourier uncertainty between a localized signal feature and a sharp frequency cut-off. Recognizing the latter as a trade-off between the achievable resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio, that is the information transmitted with each degree of freedom, both strategies can be interpreted as different manifestations of the same principle, which identifies the total information capacity of the imaging system as the defining system parameter, rather than the signal resolution. This in turn allows one to relate various superresolution imaging methods, as well as superoscillations, and generalized and compressive sampling schemes to one another.},

Ultrasonic velocity and attenuation seem to be governed by the changes in the casein micellar structure as the acid dissolves the micellar calcium phosphate. Both parameters show only small effects of gelation. The DWS shows that there are large differences between heated and unheated milks, especially in respect of the photon mean free path in the milks before coagulation has occurred. Measurement of the particle sizes by this technique shows that slow aggregation occurs at pH values considerably higher than those at which the full gelation of the casein micelles is seen to occur. The general conclusion is that the process of acidification, especially in heated milks, may be less simple than had previously been supposed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, sparse representation methods via L1 regularization and convex optimization are a relatively new approach for effective analysis and processing of digital images and signals. In this article, a numerical optimization method for analyzing LR-NMR data by including non-negativity constraints and L1 regularization and by applying a convex optimization solver PDCO, a primal-dual interior method for convex objectives, that allows general linear constraints to be treated as linear operators is presented. The integrated approach includes validation of analyses by simulations, testing repeatability of experiments, and validation of the model and its statistical assumptions.

Microrheology provides a technique to probe the local viscoelastic properties and dynamics of soft materials at the microscopic level by observing the motion of tracer particles embedded within them. It is divided into passive and active microrheology according to the force exerted on the embedded particles. Particles are driven by thermal fluctuations in passive microrheology, and the linear viscoelasticity of samples can be obtained on the basis of the generalized Stokes-Einstein equation. In active microrheology, tracer particles are controlled by external forces, and measurements can be extended to the nonlinear regime. Microrheology techniques have many advantages such as the need for only small sample amounts and a wider measurable frequency range. In particular, microrheology is able to examine the spatial heterogeneity of samples at the microlevel, which is not possible using traditional rheology. Therefore, microrheology has considerable potential for studying the local mechanical properties and dynamics of soft matter, particularly complex fluids, including solutions, dispersions, and other colloidal systems. Food products such as emulsions, foams, or gels are complex fluids with multiple ingredients and phases. Their macroscopic properties, such as stability and texture, are closely related to the structure and mechanical properties at the microlevel. In this article, the basic principles and methods of microrheology are reviewed, and the latest developments and achievements of microrheology in the field of food science are presented.},

abstract = {Water-binding capacity (WBC) is commonly measured with a centrifugation method in which a sample is hydrated in excess water and the pellet weight after centrifugation defines the WBC. When a dispersion is being analyzed, here containing whey protein microparticles (MPs), the pellet consists of swollen particles and water between the particles. These two water domains in MP pellets were distinguished using time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD NMR). This distinction showed that an increase in WBC from 2 to 5.5 g water/g dry matter was mainly due to an increase in water between the MPs. Besides, it was found that TD NMR-measurements could be used to provide accurate values of the amount of water in both water domains in MP pellets. This makes TD NMR therefore a more accurate method to determine the WBC of the whole pellet than weighing the pellet after centrifugation.},

abstract = {Typical confocal Raman images consist of thousands of individual spectra from which various pieces of information can be extracted in order to display certain chemical information as an image. In order to acquire these images in a reasonable amount of time, the time required for a single spectrum must be minimized. This can be achieved through the optimization of various parts of the confocal Raman microscope. This article describes the usage of an ultra-high throughput spectrometer in combination with a spectroscopic electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera as a detector. The spectrometer is compared to a standard mirror-based Czerny-Turner spectrometer and shows twice the throughput over virtually the entire visible spectral range as well as an improvement in the line shape of recorded Raman bands. The ultra-high throughput spectrometer and the EMCCD camera in combination with a high throughput Raman microscope reduces the acquisition time for single spectra to a matter of milliseconds and significantly enhances the sensitivity of the instrument. Example measurements are presented to illustrate the speed and sensitivity of the system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The influence of low-methoxyl amidated pectin on the rheological and microstructural properties of sodium caseinate gels (2{\%}, w/v), made by acidifying with glucono-$\delta$-lactone, has been investigated at 25°C. In the absence of calcium ions, a substantial reduction in the time-dependent storage modulus was detected at pectin concentrations as low as 0.01-0.02{\%} (w/v), and a significant increase in gelation time at pectin concentrations ≥0.05{\%} (w/v). Complete inhibition of acid-induced caseinate gelation was noted at ≥0.8{\%} (w/v) pectin. Confocal microscopy has confirmed that the presence of an increasing content of pectin prevents aggregation of caseinate particles into a coherent network. Consistent with the sensitivity of both these biopolymers to calcium ions, the addition of calcium chloride (2 mol Ca2+/mol caseinate) has a major influence on the interactions in the caseinate+pectin system. Whereas for low pectin content the modulus was reduced (as for the calcium-free system), there was found to be a large enhancement of the time-dependent modulus at higher pectin contents (≥0.2{\%}, w/v). The combination of a gradual release of calcium ions from caseinate aggregates as the pH is lowered and the electrostatic adsorption of pectin onto the casein particles influences the balance of casein-casein, pectin-pectin and casein-pectin interactions in the final gel structure. Strong syneresis was clearly evident in calcium-containing systems with 0.2-0.6{\%} (w/v) pectin. Microscopy confirmed the total absence of the characteristic acid-casein gel network connections at high pectin content (0.8{\%}, w/v). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper reports a FT-IR study for probing lipid and protein structural changes and their interactions in various oil-in-water emulsions. Two different emulsions were prepared using sodium caseinate, as stabilizer system, without and with microbial transglutaminase (MTG), denominated E/SC and E/SC. +. MTG respectively. Proximate composition, fat and water binding properties and textural characteristics were also evaluated in the emulsions. Penetration force and gel strength values were used to distinguish different (P{\textless}0.05) textural behaviours depending on the formulation of emulsifying system. E/SC. +. MTG emulsion showed gel textural behaviour while E/SC lack of this property. The spectral results showed frequency upshifting of the amide I band in going from protein stabilizer systems isolate (the solution used as reference) to their corresponding emulsions, what is attributable to greater protein structural order upon emulsion formation. Enzymatic action of MTG in the sodium caseinate stabilizing system induces structural changes, in terms of lipid chain disorder or lipid-protein interactions and protein secondary modifications, which may reflect the formation of a gel structure in the emulsion. These results could help to choose the stabilizing system that is most suitable and effective for its use in the formulation of food products. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In multivariate data analysis we observe not only a single variable or the relation between two variables but we consider several characteristics simultaneously. For a statistical analysis of chemical data (also called chemometrics) we have to take into account the special structure of this type of data. Classic model assumptions might not be fulfilled by chemical data, for instance there will be a large number of variables and only few observations, or correlations between the variables occur. To avoid problems arising from this fact, for chemometrics classical methods have to be adapted and new ones developed. The statistical environment R is a powerful tool for data analysis and graphical representation. It is an open source software with the possibility for many individuals to assist in improving the code and adding functions. One of those contributed function packages - chemometrics implemented by Kurt Varmuza and Peter Filzmoser - is designed especially for the multivariate analysis of chemical data and contains functions mostly for regression, classification and model evaluation. The work at hand is a vignette for this package and can be understood as a manual for its functionalities. The aim of this vignette is to explain the relevant methods and to demonstrate and compare them based on practical examples.},

In the case of interaction, the results for filled PVA gels roughly fitted the theoretical predictions, if the deformability of the emulsion droplets and the formation of an intermediate layer between the dispersed particles and the gel matrix was taken into account.

Gels were made in volumetric flasks and petri dishes and the amount of surface whey produced by gels after 16 h was compared with the amount of supernatant expressed by low speed centrifugation (100 g x 10 min) of gels made in tubes. A central composite experiment design and response surface methodology were used. Using regression analysis a second order polynomial model satisfactorily predicted the effect of heat treatment and gelation temperature on whey separation for gels made in volumetric flasks (R-2 = 0.89). Whey separation was significantly increased by heat treatment (P {\textless} 0.001), gelation temperature (P {\textless} 0.01) and the quadratic term for heat treatment (P {\textless} 0.01). A significant (P {\textless} 0.01) positive correlation (r = 0.71) was observed between whey separation in volumetric flasks and petri dishes. It was suggested that high heat treatments and gelation temperatures favour more rearrangements of the network just after formation, making gels unstable and sensitive to spontaneous whey separation.},

Hence, extrusion die temperature was set to 60 °C in capillary rheometer experiments to mimic hot-melt extrusion based ALM. The extrudate strands were evaluated visually and recorded pressure profiles were analyzed to determine critical shear rates. It was demonstrated that critical shear rate (10–30 s−1) increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) with decreasing calcium levels and with increasing flowability (tan $\delta$60°C). By exceeding the critical shear rate, extrusion instabilities occurred indicating limitation of ALM processes.},

Several examples illustrate the new take on traditional issues like the measurement of crosslink density in vulcanized rubber or the monitoring of crystallization kinetics, as well as the unique information that can be extracted from multiphase, nanophase and composite materials. Generally, TD-NMR is capable of determining structural parameters that are in agreement with other techniques and with the final macroscopic properties of industrial interest, as well as reveal details on the local homogeneity that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Considering its moderate technical and space requirements of performing, TD-NMR is a good candidate for assisting product and process development in several applications throughout the rubber, plastics, composites and adhesives industry.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the general problem of forecasting the maximum value of a time series which by the nature of the data must approach an asymptotic value. Examples of such series include the growth of organisms, the concentration of a chemical reagent during a reaction occurring over time or the amount of a fossil fuel resource which has been discovered or produced as a function of time. The approach taken below differs from the usual models for this type of data in that it assumes that an unobserved time series is actually driving the process, and that the observed data series is a function of the unobserved process. In the case of fossil fuels the unobserved series might be a measure of the exploratory drilling, the number of production days in a given time period or even the amount of fiscal resources devoted to exploratory activities. A maximum likelihood method is developed for estimating the parameters of the process, especially the maximum S, and the covariance structure of the estimators is developed. The methodology is illustrated on an example of oil production. Finally, methods are developed for forecasting the data into the near future.

The addition of rework (in this case, to processed cheese with a spreadable consistency) in the amounts of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0{\%} (wt/wt) increased the firmness of the processed cheese. With the further addition of rework, the consistency of the processed cheeses no longer differed significantly. The conclusions obtained by the measurement of viscoelastic properties were supported by cryo-scanning electron microscopy, where fat droplets in samples with added rework of over 10.0{\%} (wt/wt) were smaller than fat droplets in processed cheeses with lower additions of rework.},

abstract = {S-carboxymethylated (SCM) ??-casein forms in vitro fibrils that display several characteristics of amyloid fibrils, although the protein is unrelated to amyloid diseases. In order to get insight into the processes that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils made of ??-caseins in milk, we have characterized in detail the reaction and the roles of its possible effectors: glycosylation and other caseins. Given that native ??-casein occurs as a heterogeneous mixture of carbohydrate-free and carbohydrate-containing chains, kinetics of fibril formation were performed on purified glycosylated and unglycosylated SCM ??-caseins using the fluorescent dye thioflavin T in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for morphological and structural analyses. Both unglycosylated and glycosylated SCM ??-caseins have the ability to fibrillate. Kinetic data indicate that the fibril formation rate increases with SCM ??-casein concentration but reaches a plateau at high concentrations, for both the unglycosylated and glycosylated forms. Therefore, a conformational rearrangement is the rate-limiting step in fibril growth of SCM ??-casein. Transmission electron microscopy images indicate the presence of 10- to 12-nm spherical particles prior to the appearance of amyloid structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra reveal a conformational change within these micellar aggregates during the fibrillation. Fibrils are helical ribbons with a pitch of about 120-130??nm and a width of 10-12??nm. Taken together, these findings suggest a model of aggregation during which the SCM ??-casein monomer is in rapid equilibrium with a micellar aggregate that subsequently undergoes a conformational rearrangement into a more organized species. These micelles assemble and this leads to the growing of amyloid fibrils. Addition of ??s1-and ??-caseins decreases the growth rate of fibrils. Their main effect was on the elongation rate, which became close to that of the limiting conformation change, leading to the appearance of a lag phase at the beginning of the kinetics.

abstract = {Water mobility changes during a structure building reaction of full-fat cream cheese were studied by applying low-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance. A significant decrease in mobility (T2 relaxation times from 148 to 116 ms) was found in the mobile water phase during texture building. Furthermore, the results were compared to forced synaeresis of the same cheese, which was determined by applying a multistep centrifugation method. The plotted forced synaeresis results displayed the inverse shape of the structure building reaction: ~14.6\% at the beginning (0 min), ~7.4\% at peak (47 min) of the reaction and ended with ~9.9\% (126 min).},

abstract = {The focus of this book is on "ill-posed inverse problems". These problems cannot be solved only on the basis of observed data. The building of solutions involves the recognition of other pieces of a priori information. These solutions are then specific to the pieces of information taken into account. Clarifying and taking these pieces of information into account is necessary for grasping the domain of validity and the field of application for the solutions built. For too long, the interest in these problems has remained very limited in the signal-image community. However, the community has since recognized that these matters are more interesting and they have become the subject of much greater enthusiasm. From the application field's point of view, a significant part of the book is devoted to conventional subjects in the field of inversion: biological and medical imaging, astronomy, non-destructive evaluation, processing of video sequences, target tracking, sensor networks and digital communications. The variety of chapters is also clear, when we examine the acquisition modalities at stake: conventional modalities, such as tomography and NMR, visible or infrared optical imaging, or more recent modalities such as atomic force imaging and polarized light imaging.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The quality and commercial value of cheese are primarily determined by its physico-chemical properties (e.g., melt, stretch, flow, and color), specific sensory attributes (e.g., flavor, texture, and mouthfeel), usage characteristics (e.g., convenience), and nutritional properties (e.g., nutrient profile, bioavailability, and digestibility). Many of these functionalities are determined by cheese structure, requiring an appropriate understanding of the relationships between structure and functionality to design bespoke functionalities. This review provides an overview of a broad range of functional properties of cheese and how they are influenced by the structural organization of cheese components and their interactions, as well as how they are influenced by environmental factors (e.g., pH and temperature).},

@article{Chojnicka2009,
abstract = {In this work the lubrication behaviour of emulsions, gels, and emulsion-filled gels was studied in relation to their composition and structure. It was found that emulsions had much lower friction coefficients than their continuous phases. Emulsions with 40 wt{\%} oil had the same friction coefficient as the pure oil. The lubrication properties of the gels, sheared by pressing them through a syringe, strongly depended on the molecular properties of the gelling agent and on the breakdown behaviour of the gel matrix. For each type of emulsion-filled gel, the lubrication behaviour was affected by the interactions between oil droplets and matrix. For gels containing oil droplets bound to the matrix, the friction coefficient gradually decreased with increasing oil concentration. For gels containing oil droplets non-bound to the matrix, the friction coefficient of the filled gels was lower than that of the same gel matrix without oil. However, no effect of the oil concentration on friction was observed. The different effects of the oil concentration on the lubrication behaviour of the various gels were explained by the relation between droplet-matrix interactions and the 'apparent viscosity' of the sheared gels. For gels with bound droplets, increasing the oil concentration resulted in an increase of the 'apparent viscosity' of the sheared gel. For gels with unbound droplets, the oil concentration did not affect the 'apparent viscosity'. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observations of both emulsions and filled gels did not reveal coalescence of the oil droplets as a result of the shear treatment inherent to friction measurements. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Stradner2001,
abstract = {The application of light scattering to concentrated colloidal suspensions has often been considered too complicated due to strong multiple scattering. Here we show that diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) permits the characterization of dynamic and static properties of such systems on a large range of time and length scales. In particular we focus on the aggregation and sol-gel transition in different colloidal systems such as latex suspensions or milk. Using DWS we obtain quantitative information about the microscopic dynamics all the way from an aggregating suspension to the final gel, thereby covering the whole sol-gel transition. At the gel point a dramatic change of the particle dynamics from diffusion to a subdiffusive arrested motion is observed. As biopolymer solutions and gels represent one of the most interesting class of gelling systems we have performed a systematic study using solutions of casein micelles which we destabilized and investigated during the sol-gel transition using DWS and rheological measurements. We can find the same behavior as found in concentrated suspensions of monodisperse latex spheres that undergo a sol-gel transition. The changes observed in the microscopic dynamics can be clearly linked to the formation of a macroscopic gel with drastically modified viscoelastic properties.},

LM techniques used in the analyses of cheeses involve bright field, polarised, fluorescence and confocal scanning laser microscopy; whereas EM methods refer to scanning and transmission EM.

abstract = {We studied the transverse NMR relaxation of protons of different chemical groups and diffusion of molecules in an aqueous pluronic F-127 system. The system was studied at concentrations of 15, 21 and 28 wt{\%} and in the temperature range of 293–333 K. The dynamic peculiarities in different phases were analyzed based on the NMR relaxation and diffusion data. Our study demonstrated a correlation between phase states, T2 relaxation times of “solid-like” and “liquid” protons of selected chemical groups of polypropylene oxide (PPO) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks, and diffusion coefficients. Transverse NMR relaxation established that the presence of a “solid-like” component of CH3 protons of PEO blocks is observed only at temperatures and concentrations corresponding to the rigid-gel phase, due to entanglements between micellar coronas. At all temperatures and concentrations, some CH3 protons of PPO blocks and some CH2 protons of PEO blocks show “liquid-like” transverse NMR relaxation. Under the conditions corresponding to formation of the rigid-gel phase of the pluronic, relaxation of the “liquid-like” protons additionally accelerates due to entanglements of micellar coronas. Transition of the system to the rigid-gel phase is accompanied by decrease of diffusion coefficients by a factor of 10–104 relative to the diffusivity of free-moving pluronic micelles in the sol phase. Diffusion measurements show that there are pre-transition phenomena, which are characteristic for temperatures and concentrations near sol-gel phase boundaries.},

Method validation consisted in testing linearity, repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy. A linear relationship (R2 {\textgreater} 0.99) between the concentrations of proteins and peak areas was observed over the concentration range, with low detection limits. Repeatability and reproducibility were satisfactory for both retention times and peak areas.

The identification of each casein was established by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

abstract = {The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is a complex soft matter system that encapsulates the milk fat globule (MFG). It is important for the successful delivery of nutrients for newborns and it is also increasingly studied for its potential pharmaceutical benefits. Yet, the persistence and integrity of the MFGM through many steps common in the processing of milk for consumption and cheese manufacture is not completely understood and is an area of ongoing interest. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the MFGM membrane interface to demonstrate the effects of mechanical force and shear encountered during milk processing. The results showed that significant differences can be observed and such a soft biological system with complex constituents can be quantitatively characterized using AFM. Major differences were observed in the surface morphology and the roughness of the MFGM in raw milk, raw ultra filtrate (UF) retentate, homogenized milk, cheese milk and cream samples. The MFGM of the homogenized fat globules showed the greatest difference in appearance when compared to the native raw MFGM from damage largely due to the homogenization process. In addition, AFM elasticity and thickness measurements of the MFGM showed quantitative differences between the five different samples with an increase in the stiffness of the MFGM of milk samples that have undergone more processing steps. The quantitative results of the physical nature of the MFGM from the AFM study, combined with the qualitative results on the chemical nature of the MFGM, demonstrate that AFM can aid in the understanding of the interfacial behaviour of complex soft matter systems where access to detailed chemical composition is limited.},

abstract = {Influence of emulsifying salts (ES) on some physical properties of casein micelles was investigated. A reconstituted milk protein concentrate (MPC) solution (5{\%} wt/wt) was used as the protein source and the effects of ES [0 to 2.0{\%} (wt/wt)] were estimated by measuring turbidity, acid-base titration curves and amount of casein-bound Ca and inorganic P (Pi). Various ES, trisodium citrate (TSC), or sodium phosphates (ortho-, pyro-, or hexameta-) were added to MPC solution, and all samples were adjusted to pH 5.8. Acid-base buffering curves were used to observe changes in the amount and type of insoluble Ca phosphates. An increase in the concentration of TSC added to MPC solution decreased turbidity, buffering at pH ∼5 (contributed by colloidal Ca phosphate), and amount of casein-bound Ca and Pi. Addition of up to 0.7{\%} disodium orthophosphate (DSP) did not significantly influence turbidity, buffering curves, or amount of casein-bound Ca and Pi. When higher concentrations (i.e., ≥1.0{\%}) of DSP were added, there was a slow decrease in turbidity. With increasing concentration of added tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP), turbidity and buffering at pH ∼5 decreased, and amount of casein-bound Ca and Pi increased. When small concentrations (i.e., 0.1{\%}) of sodium hexametaphosphate were added, effects were similar to those when TSPP were added but when higher concentrations (i.e., ≥0.5{\%}) were added, the buffering peak shifted to a higher pH value, and amount of casein-bound Ca and Pi decreased. These results suggested that each type of ES influenced casein micelles by different mechanisms. {\textcopyright} American Dairy Science Association, 2005.},

abstract = {Water activity of a system (aw) is a thermodynamic concept used to characterize the contained water. It has been considered, in spite of some limitations, as the most important parameter in food technology for the past 50 years. It can be measured by the ratio (p/p0) of the water vapor pressure in the atmosphere at equilibrium with the material to the saturated vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature, or by the physical properties related to it (freezing point depression, mechanical/electrical properties). Although the physical/chemical mechanisms responsible for the depression of aw as compared to that of pure water are more or less identified, the expressions describing the relations between composition and aw remain mainly empirical for real foods. Water activity is only one of the several water-related factors controlling quality characteristics of food,with molecular mobility being equally important. It is, however, an essential parameter to consider in situations involving microbial activity (shelf life, production of aroma, etc.). It is also an essential tool in food technology, permitting to predict the transfer of water between two compartments of a product or between a food product and its environment during storage or a drying operation. Thus, aw controls the water content of the product, and in turn the quality characteristics such as texture of cheese, and the kinetics of physical (crystallization of lactose) or chemical/enzymatic reactions.},

Heat treatment and centrifugation resulted in cream cheese with a microstructure, composition and rheological properties comparable with that of a commercial scale cream cheese. Heating was necessary to achieve effective separation, the desired product microstructure and an adequate firmness and viscosity, with the heat induced denaturation of some whey proteins contributing to these properties. Whilst both whey separation methods resulted in a similar microstructure, centrifugation led to less fat loss and an optimal product.

Using microscopy, model imitation cheese products with different lipid phases were found to have similar microstructures where fat or oil appears as inert particle fillers in a continuous protein network. Using a texture profile analyzer, we show that the textural properties of model imitation cheese are dependent on the material properties of the inert filler. Addition of rigid particle fillers generally results in greater reinforcement of the matrix (i.e., increased hardness). The addition of oat fiber particles at 5{\%} volume fraction to model cheese containing 51{\%} milk fat and 49{\%} canola oil resulted in a product with similar functionalities (i.e., hardness, oil stability, and meltability) as that of model cheese containing 100{\%} milk fat. The current study therefore shows that the addition of edible non-fat particles for matrix reinforcement can be used as an alternative method for reducing saturated fats in foods while keeping other desirable properties of the product.},

abstract = {Low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a non-invasive method widely used in the petroleum industry for the evaluation of reservoirs. Pore structure and fluid properties can be evaluated from transverse relaxation (T2) distributions, obtained by inverting the raw NMR signal measured at subsurface conditions or in the laboratory. This paper aims to cast some light into the best practices for the T2 data acquisition and inversion in shales, with a focus on the suitability of different inversion methods. For this purpose, the sensitivity to various signal acquisition parameters was evaluated from T2 experiments using a real shale core plug. Then, four of the most common inversion methods were tested on synthetic T2 decays, simulating components often associated with shales, and their performance was evaluated. These inversion algorithms were finally applied to real T2 data from laboratory NMR measurements in brine-saturated shale samples. Methods using a unique regularization parameter were found to produce solutions with a good balance between the level of misfit and bias, but could not resolve adjacent fast T2 components. In contrast, methods applying variable regularization – based on the noise level of the data – returned T2 distributions with better accuracy at short times, in exchange of larger bias in the overall solution. When it comes to reproducing individual T2 components characteristic of shales, the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (BRD) algorithm was found to have the best performance. In addition, our findings suggest that threshold T2 cut-offs may be derived analytically, upon visual inspection of the T2 distributions obtained by two different NMR inversion methods.},

We predict that a casein nano-particle radius of around 20 nm causes the strongest depletion flocculation of fine emulsion droplets (mean diameter ∼0.4 $\mu$m), i.e., corresponding to a size ratio of about 10:1. This optimum size is the result of a compromise between (i) it being small enough to generate a high number density of non-adsorbed nano-particles, and hence a substantial osmotic pressure, and (ii) it being large enough to give a substantial depletion layer thickness. It turns out that the estimated optimum size of casein nano-particles for inducing depletion flocculation is similar to the size of small casein aggregates actually found in sodium caseinate dispersions at low ionic strength. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Gels may be produced from solutions of sodium caseinate, from micellar casein dispersions, and from casein-stabilized emulsions by a variety of treatments, including heating, acidification, and high-pressure processing.

Quantitative differential centrifuga-tion for the separation of aggregates, casein micelles, dissociated submicellar particles, and soluble proteins and subsequent analysis of caseins and whey proteins within these fractions by RP-HPLC were applied. Quantitative separation was monitored by particle size measurements. The dissociation of $\kappa$-casein as well as an increase in casein micelle hydrodynamic radius were observed to increase with increasing total solid content of CSM, heat treatment time, and temperature. Heat-induced dissociation of $\beta$-Lg-$\kappa$-casein complexes at a critical level of 30–35% was found to induce severe coagulation of $\kappa$-casein-depleted calcium-sensitive casein micelles in CSM heated by DSI. Disso-ciated and aggregated proteins were found to be present as distinct colloidal particle classes differing in size from casein micelles.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that determine the diffusion and interaction of macromolecules (such as proteins and polysaccharides) that disperse through dense media is an important fundamental issue in the development of innovative technological and medical applications. In the current work, the partitioning and diffusion of macromolecules of different sizes (from 4 to 10 nm in diameter) and shapes (linear or spherical) within dispersions of casein micelles (a protein microgel) is studied. The coefficients for diffusion and partition are measured using FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) and analyzed with respect to the structural characteristics of the microgel determined by the use of TEM (transmission electron microscopy) tomography. The results show that the casein microgel displays a nonspecific attractive interaction for all macromolecules studied. When the macromolecular probes are spherical, this affinity is clearly size-dependent, with stronger attraction for the larger probes. The current data show that electrostatic effects cannot account for such an attraction. Rather, nonspecific hydration molecular forces appear to explain these results. These findings show how weak nonspecific forces affect the diffusion and partitioning of proteins and polysaccharides in a dense protein environment. These results could be useful to better understand the mechanisms of diffusion and partitioning in other media such as cells and tissues. Furthermore, there arises the possibility of using the casein micelle as a size-selective molecular device.},

Reconstituted micellar casein concentrates and milk protein concentrates of 2.5 and 10{\%} (wt/vol) protein concentration were subjected to high-pressure processing at pressures from 150 to 450 MPa, for 15 min, at ambient temperature. The structural changes induced in milk proteins by high-pressure processing were investigated using a range of physical, physicochemical, and chemical methods, including dynamic light scattering, rheology, mid-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, proteomics, and soluble mineral analyses. The experimental data clearly indicate pressure-induced changes of casein micelles, as well as denaturation of serum proteins. Calcium-binding $\alpha$S1- and $\alpha$S2-casein levels increased in the soluble phase after all pressure treatments. Pressurization up to 350 MPa also increased levels of soluble calcium and phosphorus, in all samples and concentrations, whereas treatment at 450 MPa reduced the levels of soluble Ca and P. Experimental data suggest dissociation of calcium phosphate and subsequent casein micelle destabilization as a result of pressure treatment. Treatment of 10{\%} micellar casein concentrate and 10{\%} milk protein concentrate samples at 450 MPa resulted in weak, physical gels, which featured aggregates of uniformly distributed, casein substructures of 15 to 20 nm in diameter. Serum proteins were significantly denatured by pressures above 250 MPa. These results provide information on pressure-induced changes in high-concentration protein systems, and may inform the development on new milk protein-based foods with novel textures and potentially high nutritional quality, of particular interest being the soft gel structures formed at high pressure levels.},

Strain hardening parameters were estimated from stress–strain curves using 3 different methods. Fracture stress and strain for longitudinal samples did not vary significantly with shear work input up to 26.3 kJ/kg and then decreased dramatically at 58.2 kJ/kg. Longitudinal samples with shear work input {\textless}30 kJ/kg demonstrated significant strain hardening by all 3 estimation methods. At shear work inputs {\textless}30 kJ/kg, strong anisotropy was observed in both fracture stress and strain. After a shear work input of 58.2 kJ/kg, anisotropy and strain hardening were absent. Perpendicular samples did not show strain hardening at any level of shear work input. Although the distortion of the fat drops in the cheese structure associated with the elongation could account for some of the anisotropy observed, the presence of anisotropy in the elongated nonfat samples reflected that shear work and rolling also aligned the protein structure.},

A previous study demonstrated that solid-state 31P NMR can be used to monitor the state of phosphorus in ageing cheeses. It is possible to differentiate between the mobile and immobile phosphorus species present in the cheese casein micelles. In this work, proton to phosphorus cross polarisation (CP) kinetic experiments (1H31P CP-MAS) (where MAS = magic angle spinning) enable the observation of the state of the colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP) and phosphoserine (PSer) separately in the casein micelles. Also, 1H31P CP-MAS spectra can be used to indirectly monitor the levels of micellar calcium. From the data gathered, we were able to conclude these points about the ageing process of Mozzarella cheese; in the first 20 days the cheese texture is dependent on the dynamics of free water and immobile calcium and phosphate, the CCP phosphate is mobilised at an exponential rate with the majority mobilised within the first 20 days, the driving force for CCP mobilisation is possibly the migration of water from the cheese serum into the casein proteins and CCP phosphorus is preferentially mobilised while immobile phosphoserine levels remains relatively unchanged during the early (40 days) of Mozzarella cheese ageing.},

abstract = {Model Mozzarella cheeses with varied amounts of shear work input were prepared by working molten cheese mass at 70 °C in a twin screw cooker. Rheology and melt functionality were found to be strongly dependent on total shear work input. A non-linear increase in consistency coefficient (K from power law model) and apparent viscosity and decrease in flow behaviour index (n from power law model) were observed with increasing amounts of accumulated shear work, indicating work thickening behaviour. An exponential work thickening equation is proposed to describe this behaviour. Excessively worked cheese samples exhibited liquid exudation, poor melting and poor stretch. Nonfat cheese exhibited similar but smaller changes after excessive shear work input. We concluded that the dominant contributor to the changes in properties with increased shear work was shear induced structural changes to the protein matrix. A good correlation was found between the steady shear rheological properties and the melting properties of the cheeses.},

abstract = {The effect of calcium chelators on physical changes of casein micelles in concentrated micellar casein solutions was investigated by measuring calcium-ion activity, viscosity and turbidity, and performing ultracentrifugation. The highest viscosities were measured on addition of sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), because it cross-linked the caseins. For the weak calcium chelator disodium uridine monophosphate (Na2UMP), physical changes in the solutions were negligible. Disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), trisodium citrate (TSC), and sodium phytate (SP) caused similar increases in viscosity, but had different effects on turbidity. The increase in viscosity was attributed to swelling of the casein micelles (i.e., increased voluminosity) at decreasing calcium-ion activity. The major decrease in turbidity was due to dissociation of the casein micelles. The extent of micellar dissociation was dependent on the type and concentration of calcium chelator. It seems that the micelles were dissociated in the order of SHMP≥SP{\textgreater}TSC{\textgreater}Na2HPO4{\textgreater}Na2UMP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study aims to analyze the structural changes in partially demineralized casein micelles (D-CMs) and compare them with native casein micelles (CMs) in order to provide new insights towards the subsequent changes in rehydration behavior. Two rehydration strategies were applied. First is the fast rehydration process (50 °C/1 h), close to the industrial practice, while the second one (25 °C/24 h), a slow rehydration process, used as control. The presence of large (>10 μm) and stirring resistant aggregates in D-CMs were evidenced by Static Light Scattering, being significantly higher for D-CMs rehydrated at 50 °C/1 h. As evidence from the electrophoresis results, the non-covalent interactions play a major role in aggregate formation. The decrease in the CCP concentration (−15%) leads to a more loosely packed/porous structure of D-CMs (Transmission Electronic Microscopy/Cryo-Fracture), and (as observed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Small Angle X-ray Scattering) the demineralization also contributes to increase disorder in the structure of the micelle. Fluorescence Spectroscopy data reveals the presence of casein-tryptophan residues in a more hydrophobic environment shedding light on the importance of hydrophobic interactions for the aggregation of D-CMs. In summary, the study sketches a clear picture of internal rearrangement of CMs structures, in partially demineralized conditions, followed by fast rehydration at high temperatures.}

Optimal pH conditions during manufacture ranged from 5.7 to 6.0.

abstract = {The 'creaming reaction' of a processed cheese can be traced by the change in its viscosity profile. The viscosity profile can be measured by shearing the processed cheese at a low but constant shear rate using a rheometer. We showed that this change in the viscosity profile during cooking occurred in processed cheese made from a typical formulation as well as from a fat-free model system. This indicated that the 'creaming reaction' is primarily a protein-based interaction, which takes places with or without the presence of fat. The observed viscosity profile can be explained in terms of changes in the protein structure of the molten processed cheese during processing.

abstract = {This report documents an observational study of a high-moisture washed-rind cheese. Three batches of cheese were sampled on a weekly basis for 6 wk and again at wk 10. Center, under-rind, rind, and smear samples were tested for pH, moisture, and selected mineral elements. Powder x-ray diffractometry and petrographic microscopy were applied to identify and image the crystal phases. The pH of the rind increased by over 2 pH units by wk 10. The pH of the under-rind increased but remained below the rind pH, whereas the center pH decreased for most of aging and only began to rise after wk 5. Diffractograms of smear material revealed the presence of 4 crystal phases: brushite, cal-cite, ikaite, and struvite. The phases nucleated in suc-cession over the course of aging, with calcite and ikaite appearing around the same time. A very small amount of brushite appeared sporadically in center and under-rind samples, but otherwise no other crystallization was observed beneath the rind. Micrographs revealed that crystals in the smear grew to over 250 $\mu$m in length by wk 10, and at least 2 different crystal phases, probably ikaite and struvite, could be differentiated by their dif-ferent optical properties. The surface crystallization was accompanied by a mineral diffusion phenomenon that resulted, on average, in a 217, 95.7, and 149{\%} increase in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, respectively, in the rind by wk 10. The diffusion phenomenon caused calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium to decrease, on average, by 55.0, 21.5, and 36.3{\%}, respectively, in the center by wk 10. The present study represents the first observation of crystallization and demineralization phe-nomena in washed-rind cheese.},

With increasing protein-in-water concentrations, cheese firmness increased markedly and the rheology changed from a concentrated liquid to a weak gel. A small increase in firmness was observed with increasing fat concentration and all samples were concentrated liquids. The tendency of the cheese to melt decreased as the protein-in-water concentration increased. For samples with variable fat concentrations, the tendency to melt was highest at intermediate fat concentrations; differences among samples were smaller than for the variations in protein-in-water concentrations. There were small differences in fat globule size distributions among samples. Microstructural images suggested some poorly emulsified fat in the samples at the lowest protein-in-water and highest fat concentrations. Overall, the protein-in-water concentration had a large impact on the rheological properties; fat concentration had a relatively small impact.},

Multiple examples of the involvement of hydrophobic interactions are listed. The concentration of electrostatic charge in the phosphoserine clusters of the proteins amplifies the range of electrostatic repulsion.

Hardness of the processed cheese with a low content of polyphosphate increased at a specific DSP:TSPP ratio ({\~{}}1:1 to 3:4). This trend was the same for all the polyphosphates used; only the absolute values of texture parameters were different. The same trends were observed in the ternary mixtures with PSTP, showing lower final values of hardness compared with samples containing TSPP. Hardness and cohesiveness decreased and relative adhesiveness increased in the samples with increased pH values and vice versa; the main trend remained unchanged.},

With the addition of oat fiber particles at 5{\%} volume fraction to the canola oil made cheese, the hardness of the cheese increased due to the increase in rigid fillers in the matrix. Oat fiber particles also acted as “breakers” in the matrix (like solid milk fat), that allowed for yielding at lower strain values, which can be correlated with less rubbery properties of the cheese. The possible interactions between oat fiber and canola oil resulted in a similar melting behavior of the cheese made with canola oil to that of cheese made with milk fat. These results indicate that the addition of oat fiber particles to canola oil made cheese results in similar rheological behavior with that of milk fat, which in turn, results in similar perceivable macro-properties such as similar level of firmness and melting behavior.},

abstract = {The large deformation properties of gelatine, $\kappa$-carrageenan and whey protein isolate (WPI) gels filled with bound and unbound oil droplets were studied as a function of compression speed. The rheological properties of the gel matrices controlled the compression speed-dependency of the gels containing oil droplets. Polymer gels (gelatine and $\kappa$-carrageenan gels) showed a predominantly elastic behaviour. Their Young's modulus was not affected by the compression speed. The increase of fracture stress and strain observed with increasing compression speed was related to friction between the structural elements of the gels and, for gelatine, to the unzipping of physical bonds. Particle gels (WPI gels) showed a more viscoelastic behavior. Their Young's modulus and fracture stress increased with compression speed. This was attributed to the viscous flow of the matrix and friction phenomena between structural elements of the gel. The effect of an increase in the oil volume fraction ($\phi$) on the Young's modulus was for all gels according to the Van der Poel theory. In addition, oil droplets embedded in the gel matrix acted as stress concentration nuclei and increased friction. The relative impact of these two effects was related to the viscoelastic properties of the gels and to droplet-matrix interaction. For polymer gels and gels with bound droplets, stress concentration phenomena played a relatively larger role. For particle gels and gels with unbound droplets, friction phenomena were relatively more important, increasing the viscoelastic character of the gels. As a result, an increase in $\phi$ resulted in a decrease of both fracture stress and fracture strain for polymer gels and in an increase of the fracture stress and a decrease of fracture strain for particle gels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The ES:casein ratio was kept constant at 0.2549 mol ES/kg casein. The effects of DSP:TSC ratio on cheese manufacture and post-manufacture functional properties were investigated. Hardness, assessed by texture profile analysis, heat-induced flowability and dynamic rheology were studied. Microstructural analyses were performed using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. Increasing the DSP:TSC ratio from 0:1 to 1:0 caused a decrease in processing times (from ∼18 to 12 min) and lowering of the final mixing torque values (from ∼180 to 20 F.U.) and, post-manufacture led to a decrease in cheese hardness (from ∼360 to 165 N) and G′ values at 25 °C (from ∼81 to 38 kPa) and to increased cheese fat globule size (from ∼8 to 32 $\mu$m).

abstract = {ABSTRACT We investigated the effect of pH (5.2 to 6.8) on the hydrolysis of a sodium polyphosphate in water, milk, calcium caseinate, and spreadable processed cheese, as well as the effect of pH on the cheese structure. Monitoring of the hydrolysis in water and the different milk matrices was carried out using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance technique. In general, the decrease in pH increased the hydrolysis of polyphosphates in all matrices. The presence of calcium in milk increased the rate of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis in milk was higher than in calcium caseinate, probably due to lower molecular mobility in concentrated systems with high viscosity. Increasing the pH decreased the hardness and adhesiveness of the cheeses. At low pH (5.2 and 5.6), the cheeses presented a granular structure, although, at more neutral pH (6.0 to 6.8), the structure was continuous, homogeneous, and more fluid. These results highlight the importance of precise pH control in the manufacture of processed cheeses.},

abstract = {Aggregation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has a potential risk of immunogenicity, requiring minimization of aggregate formation. We have developed a fitting formula for antibody aggregation at 40°C based on physicochemical parameters, including colloidal and conformational stabilities. An IgG1 monoclonal antibody, MAb-T, was formulated in 24 combinations of different buffer types and pH with or without sodium chloride. The fitting formula for monomer loss was successfully established by nonlinear regression analysis of the results from accelerated stability testing. Calculated monomer fraction values by the fitting formula were strongly correlated with experimental values (R2 = 0.92). The model includes secondary virial coefficient, B22, as the representative parameter of colloidal stability, and aggregation temperature, Tagg, representing conformational stability. Then, we examined charge state, conformational flexibility, and thermal unfolding profile of MAb-T to clarify the molecular basis for the different aggregation propensities in sodium acetate buffer and in sodium citrate buffer at the same pH and buffer concentration. We concluded that the accumulation of citrate anions on the surface of MAb-T is the primary source of the less colloidal and conformational stabilities, resulting in the higher aggregation propensity in sodium citrate buffer.},

abstract = {The calcium-dependent swelling process of casein microparticles (CMPs) prepared by depletion flocculation and film drying was investigated in microfluidic chambers designed for microscopic single particle analysis. Replacing the buffer with deionised water caused CMPs to swell and decompose rapidly at pH 11. The addition of 0.1 mM CaCl2 at pH 11 stopped degradation and slowed the two-phase linear growth of the particle cross section. A significant flattening of this linear growth in both phases occurred at 1 mM CaCl2, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 almost no swelling happened. At pH 8 the addition of 0.1 mM CaCl2 prevented the swelling process. A dynamic model described the two-phase swelling behaviour of CMPs under the influence of calcium in a simple way. Based on these simulations and findings from confocal fluorescence microscopy of the internal structure, we derived a general model describing the two-phase calcium-regulated swelling process of CMPs.},

abstract = {The influence of unadsorbed protein on the stability of fine oil-in-water emulsions containing sodium caseinate has been investigated. Time-dependent creaming profiles were determined at 30°C using the ultrasound velocity scanning technique. The results show that, at a protein concentration (2{\%} w/w) around that required for nearly saturation coverage of droplets, emulsion stability with respect to creaming is good (30 days), with no indication of flocculation or coalescence. At a higher protein concentration (4{\%} w/w), corresponding to considerably more protein than required for saturation coverage, creaming stability is reduced, with rapid development of a serum layer within 20 h of emulsion preparation. Further increase in protein concentration (e.g. to 6{\%} w/w) results in partial restabilization of the emulsion through the formation of a weak particle network gel. Complementary rheological studies have shown that increasing protein concentration results in pseudoplastic emulsions with significantly higher low-shear viscosities. This behaviour, directly confirmed by light microscopy, is attributed to reversible depletion flocculation of the emulsions by protein remaining unadsorbed in the aqueous phase. It is suggested that aggregation of caseinate to form sub-micelles causes depletion by small particles in a manner similar to that observed previously for micelle-containing small-molecule surfactant-stabilized systems. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Stabilized white mold cheese is a commercially important variant of traditional white mold cheese (sometimes called bloomy rind cheese) that has an extended shelf life compared with the traditional permutation. The objectives of this observational study were to document mineral element movements and the development of a pH gradient in stabilized white mold cheese, and to use novel crystallographic techniques to identify crystals that form in the rind of this cheese. Cheeses from 3 separate batches were collected from a commercial supplier at d 1, 4, 10, 14, and 18 of aging and analyzed in a randomized block design. Samples from the center and rind of each cheese were analyzed for calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, and moisture content. The effect of location within the cheese wheel was significant for all effects, whereas the effect of aging time was significant for all effects except sodium content. The interaction between location within the cheese and aging time was significant for all effects. Using powder x-ray diffractometry, the crystals that formed in the rind during aging were identified as brushite (CaHPO4 {\textperiodcentered} 2H2O). The accumulation of mineral elements in the rind resulted in a substantial decrease in calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in the center. After 18 d, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in the center had decreased by 26.4, 14.8, and 12.1{\%}, respectively, compared with the first day of aging. The observations in the present study represent the first definitive identification of crystals in the rind of a white mold cheese. The use of novel crystallographic techniques in the present study lays the groundwork for the use of this technology in future investigations of mineral element diffusion phenomena in surface-ripened cheese.},

abstract = {During heating the structure of cheese changes which impacts on the functional properties. This research compares the rheological and structural changes during heating of three types of cheese: Mozzarella, medium Cheddar, and aged Cheddar. We use small amplitude oscillation rheology and a variety of magnetic resonance techniques to study these changes. The complex viscosity of Mozzarella and the two Cheddar samples varied with temperature. A number of structural changes were identified as being responsible for variations in the rate of change in viscosity. Magnetic resonance indicated that as cheese is heated there is a progressive increase in the quantity of free water present in the cheese structure. The diffusion properties of water within the structure allowed information relating to the tortuosity and the surface to volume ratio of pores to be calculated, and subsequent analysis indicated that these properties are temperature dependent. These results indicate that significant information regarding the structural dynamics of various constituents of cheese can be monitored during heating using rheology and magnetic resonance. In particular the MR data include the first application of time dependent diffusion measurements to characterize the molecular dynamics associated with structural changes in cheese.},

abstract = {Cheese emulsion is an intermediate product for the production of cheese powder and needs to be stable, homogeneous and pumpable characteristics to convey to the spray drier. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of fat reduction and emulsifying salt (ES) amount in cheese emulsion systems on the physicochemical characteristics. Reduced-fat (RF) and full-fat (FF) white-brined cheese emulsions were produced with different dry matters (DM; 15%–25% excluding ES) and ES concentrations (0%–3% based on cheese weight). Stable cheese emulsion was obtained at lower DM in RF cheese emulsion than that of FF cheese emulsion. Reduction in the amount of ES resulted in instability of both emulsions. Apparent viscosity with pseudoplastic flow behavior significantly increased with the decrease of fat content in stable cheese emulsions. Microstructure of emulsions appeared to be related to the fat content, stability and degree of emulsification. Reduction of fat content caused to get less lightness and more greenness in color, whereas yellowness was significantly decreased by increase in the amount of ES. In conclusion, fat reduction resulted in higher viscosities of cheese emulsion due to inducing the increment of protein, and the addition amount of ES considered as very important factor to produce stable cheese emulsion without protein precipitation or cream separation. Therefore, for preparation of RF cheese emulsion using a variety of white-brined cheese, lower amounts of DM would be suggested in this study to obtain homogenous droplets in the atomizing process of spray drying. },

abstract = {The pH buffering capacity of cheese is an important determinant of cheese pH. However, the effects of different constituents of cheese on its pH buffering capacity have not been fully clarified. The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical species and chemical equilibria that are responsible for the pH buffering properties of cheese. Eight cheeses with 2 levels of Ca and P (0.67 and 0.47{\%} vs. 0.53 and 0.39{\%}, respectively), residual lactose (2.4 vs. 0.78{\%}), and salt-to-moisture ratio (6.4 vs. 4.8{\%}) were manufactured. The pH-titration curves for these cheeses were obtained by titrating cheese:water (1:39 wt/wt) dispersions with 1 N HCl, and backtitrating with 1 N NaOH. To understand the role of different chemical equilibria and the respective chemical species in controlling the pH of cheese, pH buffering was modeled mathematically. The 36 chemical species that were found to be relevant for modeling can be classified as cations (Na+, Ca2+, Mg 2+), anions (phosphate, citrate, lactate), protein-bound amino acids with a side-chain pKa in the range of 3 to 9 (glutamate, histidine, serine phosphate, aspartate), metal ion complexes (phosphate, citrate, and lactate complexes of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), and calcium phosphate precipitates. A set of 36 corresponding equations was solved to give the concentrations of all chemical species as a function of pH, allowing the prediction of buffering curves. Changes in the calculated species concentrations allowed the identification of the chemical species and chemical equilibria that dominate the pH buffering properties of cheese in different pH ranges. The model indicates that pH buffering in the pH range from 4.5 to 5.5 is predominantly due to a precipitate of Ca and phosphate, and the protonation equilibrium involving the side chains of protein-bound glutamate. In the literature, the precipitate is often referred to as amorphous colloidal calcium phosphate. A comparison of experimental data and model predictions shows that the buffering properties of the precipitate can be explained, assuming that it consists of hydroxyapatite [Ca5(OH)(PO4)3] or Ca3(PO4)2. The pH buffering in the region from pH 3.5 to 4.5 is due to protonation of side-chain carboxylates of protein-bound glutamate, aspartate, and lactate, in order of decreasing significance. In addition, pH buffering between pH 5 to 8 in the backtitration results from the reprecipitation of calcium and phosphate either as CaHPO4 or Ca 4H(PO4)3. {\textcopyright} American Dairy Science Association, 2006.},

abstract = {This work aims to investigate the effect of fat droplet characteristics in emulsion-filled gels on their dynamic rheological, tribological and microstructure properties during breakdown, and their sensory perceptions.Fat droplet characteristics investigated were the interaction of the fat droplet with the gel matrix (modulated by using different emulsifiers to yield droplets being either bound or unbound to the matrix) and the solid fat content (SFC, varying from 4{\%} to 48{\%}). Fat content was varied from 0{\%} to 20{\%}.Elastic modulus and fracture properties of these gels (determined under uni-axial compression) were affected by droplet-matrix interaction, fat content, and SFC. A mouth-mimicking tribometer connected to a CLSM was used to determine tribological properties (friction) and microstructural evolution (fat coalescence) of gels under shear. Gels with unbound droplets led to more coalescence (than bound) and increased fat content also led to more coalescence. The observed increase in fat coalescence related to a decrease in friction, which was also related to an enhancement of the perception of fat-related sensory attributes (determined by quantitative descriptive sensory analysis).The effects of unbound droplets and higher fat content on increasing coalescence and decreasing friction were further enhanced by increasing SFC. Having found that decrease in friction and increase in coalescence relates to an enhancement of perception of fat-related attributes, one would expect that increasing SFC would further enhance the perception of fat-related attributes. This was not found. We attribute this to the fact that our systems are gels that have complicated breakdown behavior.},

Control full fat cheese (CFFC) and control low fat cheese (CLFC) were used for comparison. Physical characteristics, namely texture profile, microstructure, transverse relaxation time (T2) distribution (measured by low-field NMR) and color were analysed periodically during ripening until 180 days. Texture profile analysis illustrated a significant improvement in texture of alginate added LFC (P {\textless} 0.05) as compared to CLFC. The textural attributes of LFCA1 ripened for 30 days were comparable to CFFC ripened for 60 days and beyond. A close resemblance in textural attributes between alginate added LFC and CFFC, not previously reported when using other fat replacers, was observed. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) images revealed that alginate added LFCs had smoother surfaces as compared to CFFC and CLFC, and the dense and compact protein matrix characteristic of CLFC was not observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) suggested that the fat particle size, area and volume were affected in all LFCs due to their lower fat level and these parameters increased during ripening in CFFC. NMR results revealed increase in higher mobility water fraction in alginate added cheese compared to CFFC and CLFC. Hunter L, a and b values for alginate added LFCs indicated that they were whiter than CLFC and less yellowish than CFFC at the beginning of ripening; the color of some of the alginate added LFCs was comparable to CFFC after 120 days of ripening. Overall, addition of alginate significantly improved the textural, microstructural properties and color of LFCs, affirming its potential as a promising texture modifier.},

abstract = {In recent years, wax-based oleogelation has appeared as a new and effective strategy to structure liquid oil into soft, solid-like systems, which can be exploited as alternatives for trans- and/or saturated lipidic hardstocks in the production of lipid-based food products. Waxes are crystalline gelators, consisting of a mixture of straight-chain alkanes, long-chain fatty acids, long-chain fatty alcohols, wax esters, aldehydes, ketones, glycerol esters or di-esters. Wax-based gelation arises from the crystallization of wax particles. Tuning the preparation conditions such as cooling rate, shear rate and setting temperature can alter the crystallization and gelation of natural waxes in liquid oil. A better fundamental understanding on wax-based oleogelation is therefore important to control the quality of food products, in which these oleogels could act as structuring agents. In the food industry, wax-based oleogels can be utilized to partially or fully replace the trans- and/or saturated fats in fat-based food formulations such as shortening, margarine, confectionery products, ice-cream, and whipped-cream. Furthermore, oil migration can be prevented by using wax crystals to capture the free liquid oil within a fat-based confectionery filling. The scope of this review is to provide a concise insight into structuring liquid oil using natural waxes, with the emphasis on different internal and external factors affecting the physicochemical properties of wax-based oleogels. The innovative food applications of wax-based oleogels are also discussed in details. Industrial relevance Wax-based oleogelation has been emerged as a potential alternative to conventional oil structuring. The gelling behavior of natural waxes in liquid oils is governed by the polarity of the solvents, and by the wax crystal morphologies, which are determined by the nature and chain length of the chemical components present in waxes. In addition, the gelling behavior of wax-based oleogels can be tuned by altering the cooling and shear rates, and by changing the time and temperature of cooling. These factors strongly influence the physicochemical properties as well as the storage stability of wax-based oleogels. In addition, the application of wax-based oleogel in food formulations has encountered some technical challenges due to the incompatibility between oleogels and saturated fats, and due to the insufficient amount of solid content provided by waxes. With regard to the sensorial aspect, the waxy mouthfeel might be an obstacle restricting the acceptance of wax-based products in food markets. This review therefore provides a concise overview relating to the internal (chemical composition of natural waxes, type and polarity of solvents) and external factors (cooling rate, shear rate, storage time, and co-structuring) affecting the crystallization and gelation of wax-based oleogels, as well as their potential application in producing low-saturated fat products in food industry.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the impact on the texture properties of emulsion-filled gels when saturated solid fat is replaced by unsaturated liquid oil. Whey protein aggregate, gelatin and micellar casein, were chosen to form different types of gel matrices and the fat hardness was varied by selection of the fat type and variation of the temperature. As emulsifier, either whey protein aggregates, whey protein or sodium caseinate was used. Texture properties of the filled gels were investigated by uniaxial compression. The fracture properties were affected by the presence of emulsion droplets, however the effect of fat hardness was small. The presence of emulsion droplets (either liquid or solid) increases the gel stiffness as compared to the emulsion-free gel, indicating that the droplets are an active part of the gel. An increase in solid fat content led to a moderate increase in gel stiffness for whey protein aggregate gels, which was in agreement with predictions according to the Palierne model for the effect of fat hardness on the stiffness of the filled gels. For the gelatin and micellar casein gels, the magnitude by which the gel stiffness increased as a function of the solid fat content was much larger than expected on the basis of this model. Microscopical observation suggested that this was caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of the fat droplets, due to droplet aggregation or/and concentration of the droplets in gel strands, which increases the effective volume fraction of the droplets in the matrix.},

abstract = {Milk fat emulsions from sodium caseinate (NaCas) and anhydrous milk fat (AMF) were prepared in the size range from 1 to 0.24 $\mu$m. These emulsions were used as source of fat to prepare low fat Cheddar cheese (LFC) and their properties such as composition (at day 7), proteolysis, texture profile analysis (TPA), color and microstructure (by confocal laser scanning electron microscopy) were studied during ripening for 180 days. Emulsion size affected the textural, microstructure, compositional, proteolysis and color properties of LFCs, but did not make them comparable to control FFC (control full fat cheese) and textural properties did not change significantly during ripening. This was possibly due to the relatively small size of emulsions added and their inertness that did not lead to higher moisture retention during cheese making and did not coalesce during ripening.},

abstract = {In order to slow down the evolution and to minimise the extent of syneresis in dairy products the effect of new process steps and recipes on the structure of the final products were studied. The objective of this paper was to detect structural changes with regard to the water-immobilisation of differently treated whey protein concentrates (WPC) by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The first measurements with pure WPC show obvious variations for the differently treated samples and the original native sample (a). (b) Denatured and (c) denatured and additionally sheared WPCs show not only an observably higher viscosity, but also shorter relaxation times. The fraction of the immobilised phase is about twice as high as in native WPC samples. These data reveal an improved water-holding capacity. (d) WPC samples mixed with cream and afterwards emulsified show a different behaviour with regard to their water-holding capacity during the evolution of the shearing process. The results suggest that for each treatment and/or change of the recipe the optimal shearing time has to be determined in order to achieve minimal relaxation times. These are obviously correlated with the highest water-holding capacity. The presented data indicate that NMR measurements are a useful technique to detect and analyse changes of the mobility of water and to identify fractions of differently bound/immobilised water phases of WPCs in dependence on the corresponding pre-treatment and recipe, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Two gels of different nature were studied, viz. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) - Congo red gels (a so-called rubber gel) and casein gels made by acidification of skimmed milk.

If there was no interaction between the macromolecules adsorbed on the particles and the gel matrix, both the filled PVA and the filled casein gels showed a small decrease in the elastic moduli with $\theta${\{}symbol{\}}f, approaching the behaviour theoretically predicted for foams. In the case of interaction, the results for filled PVA gels roughly fitted the theoretical predictions, if the deformability of the emulsion droplets and the formation of an intermediate layer between the dispersed particles and the gel matrix was taken into account. The increase in the elastic moduli of the acid milk gels with $\theta${\{}symbol{\}}f was much greater than expected and was probably due to aggregation of the dispersed particles during gelation. {\textcopyright} 1988 Steinkopff.},

abstract = {In this work, FT-Raman spectroscopy was explored to evaluate spreadable cheese samples. A partial least squares discriminant analysis was employed to identify the spreadable cheese samples containing starch. To build the models, two types of samples were used: commercial samples and samples manufactured in local industries. The method of supervised classification PLS-DA was employed to classify the samples as adulterated or without starch. Multivariate regression was performed using the partial least squares method to quantify the starch in the spreadable cheese. The limit of detection obtained for the model was 0.34{\%} (w/w) and the limit of quantification was 1.14{\%} (w/w). The reliability of the models was evaluated by determining the confidence interval, which was calculated using the bootstrap re-sampling technique. The results show that the classification models can be used to complement classical analysis and as screening methods.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to determine the effect and magnitude of matrix inhomogeneity on the rheological properties of emulsion-filled gels. To this end, we have investigated the rheological properties in casein gels containing different volume fractions of dispersed fat droplets with varying hardness. Rheological properties of the filled gels were investigated by uniaxial compression. Matrix inhomogeneity was controlled by changing the casein concentration, and was quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis. CLSM images showed that the matrix becomes more inhomogeneous when the protein concentration decreases and image analysis was used to quantify this inhomogeneity. As the dispersed fat droplets bind to the proteins (active droplets), the droplets are located more in the casein-rich areas. The inhomogeneous distribution of the casein micelles led to an accumulation of the dispersed fat droplets in the gelled micellar casein regions, thereby increasing the effective volume fraction of the droplets. This increase in the effective volume fraction of the droplets was higher for lower casein concentrations, due to a higher degree of inhomogeneity, resulting in a larger effect in reinforcing the gel compared to more homogeneous systems. These results may be used for designing structures to decrease the fat content or replace solid fat by liquid oil.},
