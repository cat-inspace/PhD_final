\caption{Parameters influencing the structure formation of model processed cheese}
\label{tab:lenres}
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
\hline
\textbf{Investigated parameter} &
  \textbf{Key results} \\  \hline
Stirring speed &
  \makecell[l]{Higher processing speed leads to weaker gels \\
         high shear might lead to structure corruption} \\  \\
Temperature &
  at least 70\textdegree C necessary to initiate creaming reaction \\  \\
Protein composition &
  \makecell[l]{Model matrix was derived from natural cheese with addition of \\
         2\% (w/w protein) protein powder of varying sources . \\
         Presence of whey proteins, native casein and rennet casein  \\
         promotes the occurrence of a distinct first exponential phase  \\
         acid casein and sodium caseinate lead to absence of an early\\
         exponential increase in viscosity, but show a pronounced  \\
         exponential increase in apparent viscosity at late processing times} \\  \\
Protein concentration &
  \makecell[l]{Higher concentration in proteins results in stronger gels and \\
         stronger display of a step-wise structure build-up} \\  \\
Addition of rework &
  \makecell[l]{values of 5\% and 10\% were investigated \\
        Highly accelerated structure formation, \\
        increasing with with higher rework concentration}   \\  \\
pH educt &
  Optimum pH for the creaming reaction: 5.83 - 5.96 \\  \\
Fat globule size &
  Smaller Fat globules accelerated structure formation \\  \\
Fat composition &
  \makecell[l]{Use of surface active ingredient in systems prepared w oil \\
        strongly accelerated structure formation.} \\  \\
Fat concentration & 
\makecell[l]{Lactose was used as dry-matter add on\\
        very low structure formation without presence of fat \\ 
        Presence of fat is needed to display step-wise structure formation} \\  \hline
