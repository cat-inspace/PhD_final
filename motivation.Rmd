\section{Motivation and Aim}

The aim of this project was to elucidate reactions with proteins as the main players in structure formation, which have hardly been investigated so far and therefore cannot be used in a targeted manner. A prerequisite  of the concept is to use proteins in high concentration to make them the determining factor in structure formation. However, it must be remembered that in biogenic systems, proteins rarely determine the composition of a food alone, but are usually integrated into complex systems with emulsified fat and carbohydrates, as well as minerals. Proteins also exhibit a wide range of molecular structures. Depending on the environment, they can occur as monomers, oligomers or aggregates. Furthermore, these structures can be soluble molecules, insoluble molecules at the isoelectric point, or molecules bound to the oil/air-water interface as surfactants. 
It can be assumed that the architecture of the building blocks influences the structure of the system. Processing parameters or changes in the matrix composition have a significant influence on these structures. The resulting complexity is typical for systems of biological origin and even more so for protein-dominated foods. Much is known about structure-forming processes of pure substances. However, only little mechanistic insight towards the aggregation phenomena of proteins in a concentrated and dispersed environment has been given so far.
A representative model to elucidate mechanisms and process-structure interactions in structure formation processes in multiphased, highly-concentrated protein systems are observations in product systems such as fresh or processed cheese. Structure-forming reactions take place there, which have only been described in rudimentary form so far [@Lenze2019], but are still poorly understood mechanistically. Investigation of the structure formation and characterisation of the interactions between components of such systems should lead in extended approaches to generic knowledge for highly concentrated protein systems. Fig.xx shows a complex, multistage course in the formation of this structure, which, depending on various material or milieu and process variables, was found to be reproducible in typical characteristics with varying steepness (chair, armchair or couch shape), but always in the typical form and in the higher minute range.

The course of this multistage structure formation can be triggered and modified by using different proteins, with variable concentration, with different process pre-treatment (complex mixture; fractionated single components), under variable milieu conditions (pH, temperature, ionic milieu, presence of ion-exchanging salts) and under different process conditions (shear rate, residence time). In addition, oil was found to play a direct or indirect role as a reactant for the proteins. On the surface, this initially appears easy to explain, since proteins are known to be very good emulsifiers. However, according to light microscopy observations, the emulsified oil only slowly changes its particle size in the course of the multistage structure formation reaction. The system then later loses its character as a stable emulsion-filled-gel towards a particulate gel with a far lesser elasticity. During this process, free oil becomes apparent. Fig.xx shows an image of such an over-processed, particulate gel.

```
An observation by @Brunner1991 supports the suspicion that proteins as emulsifiers may prove to be less interfacially active or stabilizing at higher concentrations. As was found, the emulsifying or fat-bearing capacity of various caseins (caseinate, rennet casein) decreases steeply in a linear fashion with increasing protein concentration (in the concentration range from 6 to 12 %).   
When oil is present, it probably plays only an indirect, passive role in these processes: we suspect that the emulsifying protein gradually diffuses away from the O/W interface, apparently because it has a higher affinity for the forming protein clusters in the continuous phase than for the oil interface. Thus, de-emulsified oil escapes. If a small amount of mass, which has already undergone this process once, is added to the complex mixture, the reaction is enormously accelerated, depending on the amount added, from a practical point of view even almost uncontrollably fast, as if an autocatalytic process were triggered. 
So far, there is no mechanistic explanation for such multistage structure formation processes or for the causes of the sequence of their individual phases. How the formation of clusters of proteins of different architecture with variable reactivity due to the environment is involved and how this can be controlled must be investigated further.
To gain a better understanding of the chemical processes during structure formation or restructuring during creaming, a model processed cheese was developed. The model composition consisted of no additional surface active ingredients (like milk fat, i.e. ore emulsified fat) other than the Casein(-ates). By this, the interaction behaviour of the Caseinates alone could be monitored.
The model cheese was processed using a Rheometer with stirring rod and processing cup up to distinct sampling times during structure formation. The differntly long processed samples were investigated in order to obtain compositional data at certain steps during structure formation in order to get a better understanding of how the Caseins are distributed during creaming in order to monitor the formation of a potentially insoluble network and particulated gel.
