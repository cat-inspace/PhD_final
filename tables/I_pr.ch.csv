@Brighenti2018;Acid induced cream cheese and the effect of low or high pressure (HP) pre-treatment and fermentation temperature (FT) by means of Rheology and numeric analysis
@Berta2016;Small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology of natural cheese compared imitation (i.e. processed cheese) in conditions relevant for baking
Sadlikova et al. (2010);"Effects of Phosphate salts on the viscoelastic properties of processed cheese, tested with oscillation rheology; "
@Salek2015b, Salek et al. (2017);Textural and viscoelastic properties of spreadable model processed cheese (dM = 35%, fat in dM 50%) as effected by mixtures of the following melting salts: disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP), medium chain (n=20) polyphosphate (PP), trisodium citrate (TSC). Hardest cheese was found in 1:1 mixtures of DSP and TSPP.  Effects of storage time was also investigated
@Awad2002;Different ratios of emulsifying salt mixtures and their effect on adhesiveness and hardness during storage.
@Brickley2008;Effect of emulsifying salts and special ratios on non-fat processed cheese, samples from TSC as emulsifying salt showed higher creaminess and lower pH
@Hougaard2015;Stability of hot processed cheese mass improved by addition of emulsifying salts during holding
@Chen2012;Increase of pH, hardness and casein dissociation with higher amounts of emulsifying salts are reported.
@Guinee2004;Overview of pasteurised or processed cheese products in terms of preparation, composition and properties
@Cunha2013;Effects of different types of fat (butter, plant oils and hydrated plant fat) in spreadable cheese analogues on mainly viscoelastic properties and consumer acceptance
@Soowiej2014;Fat replacement with inulin in model processed cheeses with added whey proteins resulted in higher cheese hardness and lower meltability
@Cernikova2018a;Effects of the addition of rework (i.e. pre-processed cheese) from 2.5 -10% on the viscoelastic properties of processed cheeses, increased firmness was reported due to rework addition, amounts exceeding 10% had no further effect
@El-Bakry2011;Casein hydration and fat emulsification investigated during processing, also with the influence of emulsifying salt reduction (resulted in weaker gels)
Noronha et al. (2008(1), 2008(2), 2008(3));"Textural properties, effect of additives monitored parameters were the hydration of the casein matrix and the emulsification of fat as investigated by T2 relaxation NMR, FTIR and texture analysis methods; Samples were taken during processing."
@Ramel2018;"Replacement of milk fat with canola oil to increase nutritional value of analogue cheese; addition of oat fibres for better product stability"
@Sharma2016;"Model mozzarella cheeses and the effect of different amounts of shear work input; non-linear increase in apparent viscosity with increasing shear work input (i.e. kneading)."
@Lee2003a;Ground work for many subsequent study like this one, step wise structure formation reported as well as its independence from the presence of fat
@Gogaev2009;Analysis of varying amounts of protein and fat concentrations on the microstructure of processed cheeses
Nagyova et al. (2014);Effect of ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts on viscoelastic properties.
@Barth2017;Effect of pH and polyphosphate on the cheese structure, measured with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance technique
@Kosfa2018;"Effect of fat and emulsifying salt reduction on physicochemical properties of white brined cheese emulsions; apparent viscosity with pseudo plastic flow behaviour increased with fat reduction; essentially a degree of emulsifying salt concentration is necessary to form a stable emulsion without effects of creaming or clustering."
@Vogt2015;Dissfusing wave spectrometry (DWS) and small amplitude oscillation rheology performed on heated cheeses (Mozzarella, medium Cheddar, aged Cheddar), progressive increase of free water in the system as cheese is heated.
