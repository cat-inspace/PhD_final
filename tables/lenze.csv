;Investigated parameter;Key results
;Stirring speed;Higher processing speed lead to weaker gels due to a proposed structure corruption from the applied shear
;Temperature;≥ 70°C necessary to initiate creaming reaction
;Protein composition;Model matrix was derived from natural cheese with addition of 2% (w/w protein) protein powder of varying sources). Presence of whey proteins, native casein and rennet casein promotes the occurrence of a distinct first exponential phase, whereas acid casein and sodium caseinate lead to absence of a first exponential phase but show a pronounced exponential increase in apparent viscosity at late processing times
;Protein concentration;Higher concentration in proteins results in stronger gels and stronger display of a step-wise structure buil-up
;Addition of rework;Highly accelerated structure formation, values of 5% and 10% were investigated, higher rework concentration also leads to even faster structure formation
;pH educt;Optimum pH for the creaming reaction to occur in this set-up: 5.83 - 5.96
;Fat globule size;Smaller Fat globules accelerated structure formation
;Fat composition;"Use of surface active ingredient in systems made from oil as the fat phase strongly accelerated structure formation; *Note: model for the present study was chosen from this data set and was the control (oil, no emulsifier, with Lactose as dry matter add-on), but used without Lactose during this trial.*"
;Fat concentration;"Presence of fat is needed to display step-wise structure formation; very low structure formation without presence of fat; Lactose was used as dry-matter add on in samples with reduced fat content"
